Although the spatial distribution of groundwater springs along wide rivers can be investigated by areal thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing, this technique is difficult to apply to mapping at a high spatial resolution and under riparian tree canopies. We present a real‐time monitoring and postprocessing method of ground‐based TIR video for determining groundwater discharge sampling points and mapping the surface water temperature. We applied this method to mapping two headwater streams in Hokkaido, Japan, in the summer. The first site was a 1.3‐km‐long reach underlain by Pleistocene andesite lava. Almost all of the springs were colder and had a different chemistry compared to that of the stream water, which supports the usefulness of TIR monitoring for determining groundwater discharge zones. Video postprocessing showed that cold groundwater springs were spaced every ∼100 m, and their distribution did not follow the topography. At the second site, cold and warm springs were underlain by Holocene volcanic ash. The cold springs mainly seeped from hyporheic and riparian zones downstream, while warm springs were at the footslope. Some cold springs had much higher solute concentrations than the stream and warm springs, which suggests that the water temperature is useful for inferring sources of groundwater discharge. At this site, the video postprocessing could map not only the locations of the cold springs but also the spatial heterogeneity of the stream temperature associated with groundwater inputs.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Groundwater discharge along channels can affect stream discharge, chemistry, and ecological communities.

Exploring the spatiotemporal evolution of flood events by ICON-FLOOD will provide a basis for flood risk management and flood adaptation strategy development.&lt;/p>;</content:encoded><dc:creator> Shuxia Wang, Liping Zhang, Gangsheng Wang, Dunxian She, Qin Zhang, Jun Xia, Yanjun Zhang</dc:creator><category> Research Article</category><dc:title> More intense and longer torrential rain and flood events during the recent past decade in Eurasia</dc:title><dc:identifier> 10.1029/2022WR033314</dc:identifier><prism:publicationname> Water Resources Research</prism:publicationname><prism:doi> 10.1029/2022WR033314</prism:doi><prism:url> https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022WR033314?af=R</prism:url><prism:section> Research Article</prism:section></item><item><link/> https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022WR033758?af=R<pubDate> Mon, 24 Apr 2023 08:40:34 -0700</pubDate><dc:date> 2023-04-24T08:40:34-07:00</dc:date><source url="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/19447973?af=R"/> Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents <prism:coverdate></prism:coverdate><prism:coverdisplaydate></prism:coverdisplaydate><guid ispermalink="false"> 10.1029/2022WR033758</guid><title> Meso‐scale Modeling of Distributed Water Systems Enables Policy Search</title><description> Water Resources Research, Accepted Article.</description><dc:description> Abstract It is widely acknowledged that distributed water systems (DWSs), which integrate distributed water supply and treatment with existing centralized infrastructure, can mitigate challenges to water security from extreme events, climate change, and aged infrastructure.

However, the impacts of climate patterns and rooting depth on water age dynamics in transpiration are inadequately investigated. In this study, variations in root‐zone water replenishment are estimated based on stable isotope compositions of precipitation and plant xylem water, and a piecewise linear mixing water age model is employed to quantify water ages in plant transpiration under five different climates. The results show that water ages in transpiration are very dynamic in all climates with a range between 1 and 229 days. Water replenishments in the root‐zone reveal whether and how much precipitation enters the root zone. Climate patterns control median (mean) water age in plant transpiration but modified by rooting depth. In wet climates, plants mainly rely on water source that originates from precipitation in the current month (accounting for about 60% on average of their water sources), while plants in dry climates largely rely on water source that originates from precipitation fallen on previous months/seasons. These indicate that climate has profound impacts on plant water source by regulating precipitation inputs, root zone water storage and residence time, and evapotranspiration. Despite the limitations of this study, our study provides an alternative way to reveal the precipitation partitioning in root‐zone and seasonal changes in plant water use of precipitation, which highlights different vegetation responses to water variability between climate types.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Water ages in plant transpiration reveal important processes of water dynamics in soil-plant-atmosphere continuum, which is regulated by water variability and availability in both precipitation inputs and root zone.

One important reason is the lack of sufficient available water quality observations because traditional laboratory analysis of water samples has high labor, financial and time costs. Low‐cost high‐frequency water quality data from in‐situ sensors provide an opportunity to solve this problem. However, long‐term sensing in complex natural environments usually suffers more significant errors. This study aimed to develop a novel method to utilize in‐situ sensor data in WWQ modeling, namely, the Bayesian calibration using multisource observations (BCMSO), which can simultaneously assimilate laboratory‐based observations and in‐situ sensor data. Both synthetic and real‐world cases of nitrate modeling were used to demonstrate the methodology, and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool was employed as the WWQ model. The results indicated that direct assimilation of sensor data using traditional Bayesian calibration generated obvious deviations in parameter inference and model simulation, which could consequently bias future predictions and affect management decision correctness. However, after proper treatment of errors in sensor data, the BCMSO method could extract meaningful information from sensor data and prevent negative impacts of errors. The modeling uncertainty was also greatly reduced. In the real‐world case, with 1 yr of subhourly electrical conductivity sensor data incorporated, the modeling uncertainty of nitrate concentration and management cost of controlling nitrate pollution were reduced by 70%. The BCMSO method provides a flexible framework to accommodate nonconventional observations in environmental modeling and can be easily extended to other modeling fields.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Uncertainty reduction in watershed water quality (WWQ) modeling remains a major challenge.

In this study, we investigate the propagation of isotope shifts in groundwater systems, induced by lateral diffusive‐dispersive isotope fractionation, on carbon and chlorine isotope signatures of chlorinated ethene plumes at steady state. We consider three distinct spatial scales (ie, pore, laboratory, and field scales) and explore isotope fractionation with high‐resolution pore‐scale simulations, flow‐through experiments, and field‐scale numerical modeling. The experimental lab‐scale investigation was carried out using cis‐dichloroethene (cis‐DCE) as model contaminant, whereas cis‐DCE and trichloroethene (TCE) were considered in the multi‐scale numerical simulations. The pore‐scale analysis of transverse displacement demonstrates significant isotope fractionation over a wide range of seepage velocities (0.1–10 m/day). The pore‐scale simulations illuminate the key role of incomplete mixing, which sustains isotopologue‐specific gradients in the pore channels and results in the strongest isotope fractionation (−6‰ for carbon; −10‰ for chlorine) at the fastest flow velocity.

In this study, we investigate the propagation of isotope shifts in groundwater systems, induced by lateral diffusive-dispersive isotope fractionation, on carbon and chlorine isotope signatures of chlorinated ethene plumes at steady state. We consider three distinct spatial scales (ie, pore, laboratory, and field scales) and explore isotope fractionation with high-resolution pore-scale simulations, flow-through experiments, and field-scale numerical modeling. The experimental lab-scale investigation was carried out using cis-dichloroethene (cis-DCE) as model contaminant, whereas cis-DCE and trichloroethene (TCE) were considered in the multi-scale numerical simulations. The pore-scale analysis of transverse displacement demonstrates significant isotope fractionation over a wide range of seepage velocities (0.1–10 m/day). The pore-scale simulations illuminate the key role of incomplete mixing, which sustains isotopologue-specific gradients in the pore channels and results in the strongest isotope fractionation (−6‰ for carbon; −10‰ for chlorine) at the fastest flow velocity. The outcomes of the flow-through experiments support the key role of isotopologue-specific aqueous diffusion also at the laboratory scale, where significant diffusive-dispersive isotopic shifts were observed at the outlet of the setup. Finally, the detailed field-scale numerical simulations, performed in a cross-section of a heterogeneous aquifer, illustrate that the microscopic diffusion-induced isotope fraction propagates at macroscopic scales.&lt;/p>;</content:encoded><dc:creator> Henning Wienkenjohann, Biao Jin, Massimo Rolle</dc:creator><category> Research Article</category><dc:title> Diffusive‐Dispersive Isotope Fractionation of Chlorinated Ethenes in Groundwater: The Key Role of Incomplete Mixing and Its Multi‐Scale Effects</dc:title><dc:identifier> 10.1029/2022WR034041</dc:identifier><prism:publicationname> Water Resources Research</prism:publicationname><prism:doi> 10.1029/2022WR034041</prism:doi><prism:url> https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022WR034041?af=R</prism:url><prism:section> Research Article</prism:section><prism:volume> 59</prism:volume><prism:number> 4</prism:number></item><item><link/> https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022WR032892?af=R<pubDate> Thu, 20 Apr 2023 12:24:30 -0700</pubDate><dc:date> 2023-04-20T12:24:30-07:00</dc:date><source url="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/19447973?af=R"/> Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents <prism:coverdate></prism:coverdate><prism:coverdisplaydate></prism:coverdisplaydate><guid ispermalink="false"> 10.1029/2022WR032892</guid><title> Coupling of water‐carbon interactions during snowmelt in an Arctic Finland catchment</title><description> Water Resources Research, Accepted Article.</description><dc:description> Abstract Snowmelt spring floods regulate carbon transport from land to streams. However, these coupled processes are rarely documented through high‐resolution measurements focused on water‐carbon interactions. We collated a state‐of‐the‐art high‐frequency dataset throughout a snowmelt and early post snowmelt period, alongside regular samples of stream water, precipitation, and snowmelt isotopes (δ18O). Our study was conducted during the 2019 snowmelt and initial post snowmelt season in a subarctic, peatland influenced headwater catchment in Pallas, Northern Finland. We measured high‐frequency dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and in‐stream carbon dioxide (pCO2). We identified a change in hydrological processes as the snowmelt season progressed and the post snowmelt season began. We found a) Overland flow dominated stream DOC dynamics in early snowmelt, while increased catchment connectivity opened new distal pathways in the later snowmelt period; b) CO2 processes were initially driven by rapid bursts of CO2 from the meltwaters in snowmelt, followed by dilution and source limitation emerging post snowmelt as deep soil pathways replaced the snowpack as the main source of CO2; c) stream carbon concentration shifted from being relatively balanced between CO2 and DOC during the early snowmelt period to being increasingly DOC dominated as snowmelt progressed due to changes in DOC and CO2 source supply. The study highlights the importance of using high‐frequency measurements combined with high‐frequency data analyses to identify changes in the processes driving water‐carbon interactions. The degree to which water‐carbon interactions respond to the continuation of Arctic water cycle amplification is central to delineating the evolving complexity of the future Arctic.

We then calibrate a deformation model to fit both historical (measured with leveling surveys) and modern (measured with Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar, or InSAR) data sets. We find that the stress history of the Kettleman City/Los Banos region with historically high subsidence plays a large role in reducing modern subsidence in that region, while declining heads in both regions are likely to result in major subsidence over the next several decades. This study highlights the need for active groundwater management to mitigate ongoing and future subsidence.

One key data set needed in this effort is accurate long-term head histories to reconstruct the stress history of aquifers for accurate deformation modeling.&lt;/p>;</content:encoded><dc:creator> Ryan Smith</dc:creator><category> Research Article</category><dc:title> Aquifer Stress History Contributes to Historic Shift in Subsidence in the San Joaquin Valley, California</dc:title><dc:identifier> 10.1029/2023WR035804</dc:identifier><prism:publicationname> Water Resources Research</prism:publicationname><prism:doi> 10.1029/2023WR035804</prism:doi><prism:url> https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR035804?af=R</prism:url><prism:section> Research Article</prism:section><prism:volume> 59</prism:volume><prism:number> 11</prism:number></item><item><link/> https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR035088?af=R<pubDate> Mon, 06 Nov 2023 09:04:59 -0800</pubDate><dc:date> 2023-11-06T09:04:59-08:00</dc:date><source url="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/19447973?af=R"/> Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents<prism:coverdate> Wed, 01 Nov 2023 00:00:00 -0700</prism:coverdate><prism:coverdisplaydate> Wed, 01 Nov 2023 00:00:00 -0700</prism:coverdisplaydate><guid ispermalink="false"> 10.1029/2023WR035088</guid><title> Intercomparison of Deep Learning Architectures for the Prediction of Precipitation Fields With a Focus on Extremes</title><description> Water Resources Research, Volume 59, Issue 11, November 2023.</description><dc:description> Abstract In recent years, the use of deep learning methods has rapidly increased in many research fields.

Annual runoff ranged over 2 orders of magnitude (&lt;3 to >;300 mm) among catchments receiving similar annual precipitation. Threshold relationships were observed with cumulative regional moisture deficits that reflected spatial–temporal differences in effective storage and antecedent moisture among catchments with differing portions of glacial‐deposit and land‐cover types. The importance of the glacial‐deposit texture and forest‐peatland cover on runoff behavior among catchments varied with weather patterns and catchment antecedent moisture states. Dry states yielded low annual runoff that ranged by 2 orders of magnitude (0–80 mm), with higher values in catchments with predominantly coarse‐textured deposits. During near normal antecedent moisture, annual runoff remained low (&lt;10 mm) in catchments associated with fine‐textured, hummocky landforms and deciduous forests. Annual runoff >;10 mm was observed only in catchments with extensive peatlands. Infrequent wet states resulted in increased runoff in all catchments; however, ranges in maximum runoff were associated with heterogeneity in catchment landforms and land covers. Integrating cumulative precipitation with the proportion of glacial‐deposit and land‐cover types within catchments can (a) represent water cycling and regional sink‐source dynamics controlling runoff and (b) provide an effective management framework for predicting climate and land use impacts on regional runoff in water‐limited, low‐relief, glaciated landscapes such as the Boreal Plain.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;We examined annual runoff from 20 meso-scale catchments over 25 years, to elucidate how interactions between physiography and long-term weather patterns influence the magnitude of spatial–temporal thresholds in annual runoff responses in water-limited, low-relief, glaciated continental Boreal landscapes.

We monitored water chemistry for 3 years (2019–2021) at a peatland catchment (Scotty Creek) and a mixed catchment (Smith Creek) in the Dehcho (Northwest Territories), within the discontinuous permafrost zone of boreal western Canada. The peatland catchment had higher DOC and dissolved MeHg, but lower total Hg concentrations (mean ± standard deviation; 19 ± 2.6 mg DOC L−1; 0.08 ± 0.04 ng DMeHg L−1; 1.1 ± 0.3 ng THg L−1) than the mixed catchment (12 ± 4.4 mg DOC L−1; 0.05 ± 0.01 ng DMeHg L−1; 3.1 ± 2.2 ng THg L−1). Analyte concentrations increased with discharge at the mixed catchment, suggesting transport limitation and the flushing of near‐surface, organic‐rich flow paths during wet periods. In contrast, analyte concentrations in the peatland catchment were not primarily associated with discharge. MeHg concentrations, MeHg:THg, and MeHg:DOC increased with water temperature, suggesting enhanced Hg methylation during warmer periods. Mean open water season DOC and total MeHg yields were greater and more variable from the peatland than the mixed catchment (1.1–6.6 vs. 1.4–2.4 g DOC m−2; 5.2–36 vs. 6.1–10 ng MeHg m−2).

Therefore, if mechanical dispersion is negligible as is often the case, the only aquifer property that affects the recovery efficiency is the aquifer thermal conductivity. The field‐scale aquifer thermal conductivity λ can therefore be inferred from the recovery efficiency of a push‐pull heat recovery test. Remarkably, an increase in C0 could either increase, decrease, or not affect the recovery efficiency, depending on the thermal plume geometry.

The spawning process increases redd sediment hydraulic conductivity, KD, by removing fines, creating an egg pocket with larger sediment grains such that egg pocket hydraulic conductivity, KEP, may be higher than KD. Salmon females may create one or more egg pockets within a single redd. Although the impact of redd shape and KD on redd‐induced hyporheic fluxes has been studied, the effects of streambed roughness, R, egg pocket permeability, and egg pocket location on egg pocket hyporheic fluxes, , (downwelling flows from the stoss side of the redd which may enter egg pockets) have not yet been quantified. This study investigates this knowledge gap with a set of numerical simulations supported by flume experiments. We simulated hyporheic flows for five egg pocket locations, five KEP values from 0.0025 to 0.02 m/s, and 12 rough streambed surfaces. Surface roughness was scaled from a measured streambed surface in two ways—only vertically (R1) and both vertically and horizontally (R2)—with scaling coefficients ranging from 0.5 to 3. The measured streambed surface had a median diameter, D50, of 1 cm and a standard deviation (σD) of 0.77 cm. The results indicate that the dimensionless flux into the egg pocket, increases noticeably with the downstream distance of egg pockets from the redd pit, and less strongly with . The near‐surface downwelling fluxes significantly increase with R1, but only negligibly with R2, and for deeper egg pockets, is minimally impacted by surface roughness. Our results suggest that the typical simplification of a smooth redd surface with a single redd hydraulic conductivity provides a good representation of the interstitial flow within the redd, and the effects of surface roughness and egg pocket hydraulic conductivity on fall within the uncertainty of the egg pocket location.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Salmon spawning activities alter streambed morphology, forming a dune-shaped egg nest called a redd.

However, this rate displayed profound variability between permeability field realizations sharing the same heterogeneity statistics, even under mild permeability heterogeneity.

However, these metrics do not provide much insight into what is hydrologically wrong if a model fails to simulate observed streamflow well and they are also not applicable for ungauged catchments. Here, we propose a signature‐based hydrologic efficiency (SHE) metric by replacing the statistical components of current efficiency metrics with hydrologic signatures that can be regionalized for model evaluation in ungauged catchments. We test our new efficiency metric across 633 catchments from Great Britain. Strong correlations with Spearman rank and Pearson correlation values around 0.8 are found between our proposed metric and commonly used statistical evaluation metrics (NSE, KGE, and NP) demonstrating that the proposed SHE metric is related to existing metrics as much as these metrics are related to each other. For ungauged catchments, we regionalize the three signatures included in SHE and find that 78% of catchments have an absolute difference of SHE values between gauged and ungauged cases of less than 0.2. This difference varies depending on the quality of the regionalized bias and variance signature values. It means that the SHE metric is applicable for model evaluation in ungauged catchments if its signatures can be regionalized well. When applying the SHE metric in other domains with different hydrologic properties, modellers should carefully consider the components of the proposed metric with signatures best suited to their research domains and their regionalization potential.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Rainfall-runoff models are commonly evaluated against statistical evaluation metrics.

The accurate prediction of soil moisture (SM) is essential for the rational exploitation of water resources. Data‐driven deep learning methods are widely used in many fields; however, the lack of physical mechanisms limits their application in hydrological fields, especially for SM prediction in unsaturated zones. To solve this problem, this study proposes a new deep learning method that introduces the water balance principle, Richard&#39;s equation, and SM boundary conditions as constraints to construct the new loss function that guides the training process of deep learning, called physics‐informed deep learning (PIDL). In tests consisting of a large number of data sets acquired from in situ observation sites in the field, PIDL exhibits higher accuracy than ordinary deep learning (long short‐term memory) and physical models, with 51.03% and 53.46% reduction in root mean square error of SM prediction, respectively. PIDL performance significantly improved in predicting scenarios that are difficult for ordinary deep learning to handle, such as sparse data sets, extreme values, and mutated values. In addition, PIDL maintains high accuracy over a longer prediction period. The addition of physical mechanisms allows deep learning to mine patterns not only from the data itself but also from a priori physical theoretical knowledge for guidance, and this hybrid modeling approach can also be generalized to prediction problems in other hydrological domains.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Water transport in the unsaturated zone is an important part of the hydrological cycle and is the link between the atmosphere‒soil-groundwater for material and energy transport.

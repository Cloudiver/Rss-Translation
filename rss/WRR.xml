Yet, water resources, a critical input in the production of these goods, are delineated along natural landscape features (ie, watersheds). The boundary mismatch between water resources and the associated production of economic goods conceals hydrologic dependencies and vulnerabilities in the provisioning of Food-Energy-Water (FEW) resources. In this study, we pair economic, infrastructure, and hydrologic data to evaluate the production of food, electricity, and treated water within watersheds of the conterminous United States. The US FEW sectors produced 950 million tonnes of crops, 3,973 million MWh of electricity, and supplied water to 263 million people in 2017. FEW production consumed 128 km&lt;sup>;3&lt;/sup>; of blue water (18%) and 583 km&lt;sup>;3&lt;/sup>; of green water (82%). Watersheds in central and southern California, the Midwest, and the Southwest have the largest FEW blue water consumption and the greatest exposure to water stress. Nearly three-fifths of FEW production occurs in regularly water-stressed watersheds. FEW production in watersheds in the Great Plains and Midwest relies heavily on groundwater to buffer against intra- and inter-annual streamflow variability, while surface reservoir storage buffers against water shortages in all watersheds. We show where FEW production may be susceptible to curtailments due to ongoing groundwater depletion or known infrastructure deficiencies. This study adds to our understanding of how a nation&#39;s water resources and associated infrastructure support economic activity, as well as areas where economic activity is exposed to hydrological and infrastructure risks.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This article is protected by copyright.

The response of these systems to precipitation/snowmelt events is influenced by the local storage deficit and connectivity between storage features. To estimate runoff generated from a heterogeneous wetland complex, a closed‐form analytical upscaled probabilistic model is developed. The mathematical solution requires information on the distribution of initial deficits and wetland local contributing areas, which may be estimated via a combination of spatial analysis and field observation. The model is used to explore the influence of spatial heterogeneity of wetland properties including deficit depth, local contributing area, and cascade depth (the number of wetlands in‐series within a cascade) on runoff response.

The closed form probabilistic mathematical solution is verified by comparing results with Monte Carlo simulations. The proposed runoff model has been implemented in Raven, a hydrologic model, to test the method performance in lumped runoff simulation of wetland‐dominated basins influenced by fill‐and‐spill hydrology.

Because of the lack of evaporation spatiotemporal “true” values, the corrected water‐balance‐derived evaporation was used as the temporal reference, and the ensemble mean of multiple evaporation products was used as the spatial reference. We find that trade‐offs between the spatial and temporal accuracy of CR models with fixed parameters for basin evaporation should be considered in the application. Although four CR models with fixed parameters exhibited different spatial and temporal performances, their overall performance was generally similar. The parameters of CR models had consistent spatial and temporal sensitivities, and the sensitivity of parameter αe was stronger than that of other parameters. This study demonstrates that CR models with distributed parameters have a promising future in estimating basin or regional evaporation.

Despite this, reservoirs are frequently excluded or poorly represented in large‐scale hydrological models, which can be partly attributed to a lack of open‐access data describing reservoir operations, inflow and storage. To help inform the development of reservoir operation schemes, we collate a suite of hydrological signatures designed to detect the impacts of reservoirs on the flow regime at large‐scales from downstream flow records only. By removing the need for pre‐and‐post‐reservoir flow timeseries (a requirement of many pre‐existing techniques), these signatures facilitate the assessment of flow alteration across a much wider range of catchments. To demonstrate their application, we calculate the signatures across Great Britain in 111 benchmark (ie, near‐natural) catchments and 186 reservoir catchments (where at least one upstream reservoir is present). We find that abstractions from water resource reservoirs induce deficits in the water balance, and that pre‐defined flow releases (eg, the compensation flow) reduce variability in the downstream flow duration curve and in intra‐annual low flows. By comparing signatures in benchmark and reservoir catchments, we define thresholds above which the influence of reservoirs can be distinguished from natural variability and identify 40 catchments significantly impacted by the presence of reservoirs.

We used 5‐min rainfall and storm runoff data for 30 events to calibrate the Green–Ampt (GA) and the Spatially Variable Infiltration (SVI) models and predict runoff responses for a small, degraded grassland catchment on Leyte Island (the Philippines), where infiltration‐excess overland flow (IOF) is considered the dominant runoff process. SVI replicated individual stormflow hydrographs better than GA, particularly for events with small runoff responses or multiple peaks. Calibrated parameter values of the SVI model (ie, spatially averaged maximum infiltration capacity, Im and initial abstraction, F0) varied markedly between events, but were statistically significant and negatively correlated with (mid‐slope) soil moisture content at 10 cm (SWC10)—as did the “catchment‐wide effective” hydraulic conductivity (Ke) of the GA model. Using SWC10‐based estimates of F0 and Im in SVI yielded satisfactory to good simulations for 11 out of 17 events with runoff coefficients ≥15%, but failed to reproduce the hydrographs for events with very small runoff amounts (0.25–1 mm) and low runoff coefficients (3%–6%). The median field‐measured near‐surface Ksat (2 mm hr−1) was distinctly lower than the median Im (32 mm hr−1) and, to a lesser extent, Ke (∼8 mm hr−1), suggesting an underestimation of the spatially averaged Ksat by the field measurements. Application of SVI is expected to give the most realistic results for situations where IOF is dominant, that is, where surface conditions are degraded and rainfall intensities high.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Predicting catchment stormflow responses after tropical deforestation remains difficult.

The Oregon Cascade Range is highly sensitive to warming and as a result has experienced the largest mountain snowpack losses in the western US since the mid‐20th century, including a record‐breaking snow drought in 2014–2015 that culminated in a state of emergency. While Oregon Cascade snowpacks serve as the state&#39;s primary water supply, short instrumental records limit water managers&#39; ability to fully constrain long‐term natural snowpack variability prior to the influence of ongoing and projected anthropogenic climate change. Here, we use annually‐resolved tree‐ring records to develop the first multi‐century reconstruction of Oregon Cascade April 1st Snow Water Equivalent (SWE). The model explains 58% of observed snowpack variability and extends back to 1688 AD, nearly quintupling the length of the existing snowpack record. Our reconstruction suggests that only one other multiyear event in the last three centuries was as severe as the 2014–2015 snow drought. The 2015 event alone was more severe than nearly any other year in over three centuries. Extreme low‐to‐high snowpack “whiplash” transitions are a consistent feature throughout the reconstructed record. Multi‐decadal intervals of persistent below‐the‐mean peak SWE are prominent features of pre‐instrumental snowpack variability, but are generally absent from the instrumental period and likely not fully accounted for in modern water management. In the face of projected snow drought intensification and warming, our findings motivate adaptive management strategies that address declining snowpack and increasingly variable precipitation regimes.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The western United States (US) is a hotspot for snow drought.

Here we experimented with three different formulas in a global hydrological model (the World‐wide HYPE), using 15 years of observations from 5,338 streamflow gauges and global evapotranspiration from Earth‐observations (MOD16). We tested model performance in a multi‐process approach to select the best formula for catchments covering the global landmass. From comparing the results with land‐cover, climate classification, water‐energy limitations, we found that climate is the main driver behind the spatial patterns in model performance. Hargreaves was the best PET formula in 50% of the catchments, most of them located in the Amazonas, central Europe, and Oceania; Jensen‐Haise was better for catchments in northern latitudes (36%). Finally, Priestley‐Taylor was the best formula for India and latitudes above 65° North. The selection of a PET formula seems to be more critical in tropical regions close to the equator, where the differences in performance are above 50%. This is also where PET is highest. We found a strong connection between the five main Köppen regions and the PET formulas, further supported by landcover analysis. Hence, the PET formulas differed in their capacity to provide useful input to the water balance modeling, with complex formulas only giving improved predictions in temperate and polar regions; however, for the rest of the globe simpler formulas were better. We thus recommend to apply different PET formulas based on climatic regions world‐wide.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Although many potential evapotranspiration (PET) formulas are available, there is still a lack of knowledge on when and where to use them in catchment modeling world-wide.

Yet, little understanding exists for transport in rivers in the presence of bedforms, which may trap grains and thereby influence travel distance. In a series of flume experiments with a sandy gravel bed in a large experimental flume, bed elevation and tracer travel distances were measured at high resolution for a range of discharges. As discharge increased, bedform height increased and bedform length decreased, increasing bedform steepness. For all tracer sizes and flow conditions, bedforms act as primary controls on the tracer travel distances. Bedform trapping increases linearly with the ratio of bedform height to tracer grain size, with 50% trapping efficiency for a ratio of two and 90% trapping efficiency for a ratio of four. A theoretical model based on the extended active layer formulation for sediment transport is able to capture much of the distribution of measured travel distances for all tracer sizes and discharges, providing a first connection between tracer transport theory and bedform trapping and indicating normal diffusion of tracers at relatively small timescales. Variable bedform geometry can influence trap efficiency for individual bedforms and the theoretical model can help identify “preferential trapping” conditions. The distribution of tracer travel distances for a mixture of grain sizes and variable discharge, as expected in natural rivers, displays heavy tail characteristics.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Predicting the transport of bedload tracer particles is a problem of significant theoretical and practical interest.

In this study, combinations of different structures—that is, boxes, steps and a new type of subsurface structure (L‐shaped structure)—were considered to evaluate their potential applicability on river restoration. Flow‐3D and COMSOL were applied to simulate surface and subsurface flow, respectively. The performance of the structures was evaluated on the basis of hyporheic flow and residence time distributions. For the structure sizes here considered, results showed for steps (single step, combination of two steps) and L‐shaped structures (single L‐shaped structure, combination of two L‐shaped structures) most hyporheic flowpaths return to the stream after 5 and 2.5 hr, respectively. Instead, shorter residence times (&lt;0.25 hr) were found for boxes (single box, combination of two boxes). For combinations of steps and permeable boxes, the values of hyporheic flow per unit width are higher (0.35 and 0.3 m2/hr, respectively) than for the combination of L‐shaped (0.06 m2/hr). As a result, the combinations of steps and boxes are more effective in increasing hyporheic flow. However, when subsurface structures are combined with steps the resulting hyporheic exchange is dominated by the steps. Therefore, the combined use of in‐stream and subsurface structures separately may increase their benefits for hyporheic exchange, but when steps are the other subsurface structures provide minor advantages.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The deployment of artificial structures in streambeds has been proposed as a way to enhance 21 hyporheic exchange, and numerical models can be used to quantify their effects.

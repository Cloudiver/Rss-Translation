However, insights are lacking regarding the control of climate conditions on RLs&#39; performances and how they are affected by different geographic configurations. This study applies a 2D hydrodynamic model to perform a catchment‐scale performance assessment of RLs beyond the scope of analytical and hydrological models. We conduct extensive numerical experiments of rainstorm‐induced flooding in a rural‐urban catchment with a constructed RL and blueprinted ones upstream. Results demonstrate an L‐shaped band of satisfactory performance of the current RL in the frequency‐duration diagram, which coincides with short return periods (&lt;5 years) and long durations (>;4 hr), or short durations (&lt;3 hr) and moderate to long return periods (5–50 years); such L‐shaped pattern is also valid for additional RLs and their combinations. With the increase in event size, the first two modes of RL performance (out of four) correspond to effective flood mitigation. When working jointly, RLs with series configurations are more effective in reducing the mainstream flood peaks, while parallel connections provide a greater spatial extent of flood hazard mitigation. For both series and parallel configurations, the upstream‐weighted settings tend to outperform downstream‐weighted ones under more extreme events; the decentralized arrangement in the urban area yields more benefits in spatial flood hazard mitigation compared to the centralized case. The study highlights the critical role of rainstorm severity (with possible spatiotemporal variabilities) in controlling RL performances despite various configurations and hydraulic settings.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Flood retention lakes (RLs) are widely employed in rural-urban catchments with low impacts on the natural environment.

Field observations show that the lake dynamics were modified by the bubble plumes, showing enhanced mixing in the near‐field of the plumes. The interaction of the bubble‐induced flow with the internal density structure resulted in downwelling of warm water into the hypolimnion in the far‐field of the plumes. Within the bottom boundary layer (BBL), both lakes show weak oscillating flows primarily induced by seiching. The vertical profile of mean velocity within 0.4 m above the bed follows a logarithmic scaling. One lake shows a larger drag coefficient than those in stationary BBLs, where the classic law‐of‐the‐wall is valid. The injection of oxygen elevated the water column DO and hence, altered the DO flux across the SWI. The gas transfer velocity is driven by turbulence and is correlated with the bottom shear velocity. The thickness of the diffusive boundary layer was found to be consistent with the Batchelor length scale. The dynamics of the surface renewal time follow a log‐normal distribution, and the turbulent integral time scale is comparable to the surface renewal time. The analyses suggest that the effect of bubble plumes on the BBL turbulence is limited and that the canonical scales of turbulence emerge for the time‐average statistics, validating the turbulence scaling of gas transfer velocity in low‐energy lakes.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;We quantify the lake dynamics, near-bottom turbulence, flux of dissolved oxygen (DO) across the sediment-water interface (SWI) and their interactions during oxygenation in two lakes.

The information gained from flood risk models is essential in effective disaster risk management. However, vulnerability estimations are often a large driver of uncertainty, and flood damage is rarely estimated due to a lack of empirical damage data from flood events. This study uses a unique data set with experienced damages and the implementation of flood damage mitigation (FDM) measures on the household level, collected after the flood event in the Netherlands in 2021. Flood damage models that control for several hazard, exposure, and vulnerability indicators are estimated and allow for additional input in flood risk models. Previous estimates of the effectiveness of FDM measures are prone to a selection bias, as households that do, and do not implement FDM measures systematically differ in their risk profiles. By using an instrumental variable‐estimation, this study overcomes this selection bias and finds significant reductions in flood damage due to FDM measures. These reductions can be incorporated in multivariate flood vulnerability estimations, which indicate that FDM measures significantly reduce flood damage.

Despite of numerous studies about SCA and TCA, none has focused on the investigation of existing EL definitions and adaption of point‐scale SCA concept to two‐dimensional pixel of digital elevation model (DEM). This work conducts a systematic research on rationality of existing EL definitions, proposal of new EL definition and concept of pixel‐scale SCA on gridded DEM. To overcome the defects of existing EL definitions, a new EL definition based on Triangular Discretization and Spatial Geometry (TDSG) is proposed in this work.

Despite of numerous studies about SCA and TCA, none has focused on the investigation of existing EL definitions and adaption of point-scale SCA concept to two-dimensional pixel of digital elevation model (DEM). This work conducts a systematic research on rationality of existing EL definitions, proposal of new EL definition and concept of pixel-scale SCA on gridded DEM. To overcome the defects of existing EL definitions, a new EL definition based on Triangular Discretization and Spatial Geometry (TDSG) is proposed in this work. SCA concept is extended from point scale to pixel scale for adapting to context of gridded DEM.

For example, frozen conditions impede water flow and solute transport in soil, while heat and mass transfer are significantly affected by high thermal inertia generated from water‐ice phase change during the freeze‐thaw cycle. To assist in understanding these subsurface processes, the current study presents a coupled two‐dimensional model, which examines heat conduction‐convection with water‐ice phase change, soil water (liquid water and vapour) and groundwater flow, advective‐dispersive solute transport with sorption, and soil deformation (frost heave and thaw settlement) in variably saturated soils subjected to freeze‐thaw actions. This coupled multiphysics problem is numerically solved using the finite element method. The model&#39;s performance is first verified by comparison to a well‐documented freezing test on unsaturated soil in a laboratory environment obtained from the literature. Then based on the proposed model, we quantify the impacts of freeze‐thaw cycles on the distribution of temperature, water content, displacement history, and solute concentration in three distinct soil types, including sand, silt and clay textures. The influence of fluctuations in the air temperature, groundwater level, hydraulic conductivity, and solute transport parameters was also comparatively studied.The results show that (i) there is a significant bidirectional exchange between groundwater in the saturated zone and soil water in the vadose zone during freeze‐thaw periods, and its magnitude increases with the combined influence of higher hydraulic conductivity and higher capillarity; (ii) the rapid dewatering ahead of the freezing front causes local volume shrinkage within the non‐frozen region when the freezing front propagates downward during the freezing stage and this volume shrinkage reduces the impact of frost heave due to ice formation. This gradually recovers when the thawed water replenishes the water loss zone during the thawing stage; and (iii) the profiles of soil moisture, temperature, displacement, and solute concentration during freeze‐thaw cycles are sensitive to the changes in amplitude and freeze‐thaw period of the sinusoidal varying air temperature near the ground surface, hydraulic conductivity of soil texture, and the initial groundwater levels. Our modelling framework and simulation results highlight the need to account for coupled thermal‐hydraulic‐mechanical‐chemical behaviours to better understand soil water and groundwater dynamics during freeze‐thaw cycles and further help explain the observed changes in water cycles and landscape evolution in cold regions.

Despite the emphasis in the literature on the most severe hydrological responses to wildfire, there remains a knowledge gap on the thresholds of wildfire (ie, burned area/drainage area ratio, BAR) required to initiate hydrological responses. We investigated hydrological changes in the Russian River Watershed (RRW) in California, a coastal, Mediterranean, drought‐prone, wildfire‐adapted ecosystem, following ten wildfires that burned 30% of the watershed. Our findings suggest that sub‐watersheds of the RRW have not burned beyond an intrinsic, unknown, threshold required to initiate change. Using paired watersheds, we examined spatiotemporal patterns of pre‐and‐post wildfire hydrology with a rainfall‐runoff hydrological model. Even though these successive wildfires burned 1%–50% of each sub‐watershed (1%–30% at moderate/high severity), we found little evidence of wildfire‐related shifts in hydrology. As a function of BAR, wildfire imposed limited effects on runoff ratios (runoff/precipitation) and runoff residuals (observations—model simulations). Our findings that post‐wildfire runoff enhancements asymptote beyond 30% burn indicate that when a watershed is burned beyond a certain threshold, the magnitude of the hydrologic response no longer increases. Drought and storm conditions explained much of the variability observed in streamflow, whereas wildfire explained only moderate variability in streamflow even when wildfire accounted for >;45% BAR. While the BAR in the RRW was sufficiently beyond previously reported minimum disturbance thresholds (>;20% burned forest), the lack of hydrological response is attributed to buffering effects of wildfire adaptation and drought factors that are unique to Mediterranean ecoregions.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Wildfires naturally occur in many landscapes, however they are undergoing rapid regime shifts.

Despite this recognition, plant access to groundwater is often neglected in global evaporation models. This study proposes a new, conceptual approach to incorporate plant access to groundwater in existing global evaporation models, and analyses the groundwater contribution to evaporation globally. To this end, the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) is used. The new GLEAM‐Hydro model relies on the linear reservoir assumption for modelling groundwater flow, and introduces a transpiration partitioning approach to estimate groundwater contributions. Model estimates are validated globally against field observations of evaporation, soil moisture, discharge and groundwater level for the time period 2015–2021, and compared to a regional groundwater model. Representing groundwater access influences evaporation in 22% of the continental surface. Globally averaged, evaporation increases by 2.5 mm year−1 (0.5% of terrestrial evaporation), but locally, evaporation can increase up to 245.2 mm year−1 (149.7%). The groundwater contribution to transpiration is highest for tall vegetation under dry conditions due to more frequent groundwater access. The temporal dynamics of the simulated evaporation improve across 75% of the stations where groundwater is a relevant water source. The skill of the model for variables such as soil moisture and runoff remains similar to GLEAM v3. The proposed approach enables a more realistic process representation of evaporation under water‐limited conditions in satellite‐data driven models such as GLEAM, and sets the ground to assimilate satellite gravimetry data in the future.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Groundwater is an important water source for evaporation, especially during dry conditions.

Model estimates are validated globally against field observations of evaporation, soil moisture, discharge and groundwater level for the time period 2015–2021, and compared to a regional groundwater model. Representing groundwater access influences evaporation in 22% of the continental surface. Globally averaged, evaporation increases by 2.5 mm year&lt;sup>;−1&lt;/sup>; (0.5% of terrestrial evaporation), but locally, evaporation can increase up to 245.2 mm year&lt;sup>;−1&lt;/sup>; (149.7%). The groundwater contribution to transpiration is highest for tall vegetation under dry conditions due to more frequent groundwater access. The temporal dynamics of the simulated evaporation improve across 75% of the stations where groundwater is a relevant water source. The skill of the model for variables such as soil moisture and runoff remains similar to GLEAM v3. The proposed approach enables a more realistic process representation of evaporation under water-limited conditions in satellite-data driven models such as GLEAM, and sets the ground to assimilate satellite gravimetry data in the future.&lt;/p>;</content:encoded><dc:creator> P.

We found a positive correlation between the presence of treatment plants and T&amp;E species in California watersheds—a quarter of species have 100% of their range in watersheds with at least one treatment plant. This correlation is greatest for species associated with terraces and riparian habitat, followed by aquatic emergent vegetation and habitat. One‐third of watersheds in our analysis can receive most of their cumulative watershed baseflow from effluent and are characterized by dense urbanization or agriculture. Our analysis demonstrates that the fates of T&amp;E species and effluent are interconnected in ways important for water policy, suggesting that species conservation goals should be considered when making decisions about effluent reuse.

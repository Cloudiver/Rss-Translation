Thus, understanding their interaction with and transport through materials is important. We examine the impact of nanoparticle hydrophobicity and porous medium surface area on the transport of carbon nanoparticles through sand‐packed columns under saturated and unsaturated conditions. The fluorescent carbon nanoparticles (FCNs) used in this study, synthesized from citric acid and ethanolamine, exhibit synthesis‐temperature‐dependent hydrophobicity. To quantify the impact of hydrophobicity on retention, we use FCNs synthesized at four temperatures: 190˚C (FCN190), 210˚C (FCN210), 230˚C (FCN230), and 250˚C (FCN250). Several observations are noted. First, the more hydrophobic particles (FCN230 and FCN250) attain lower outlet concentrations and mass recovery than more hydrophilic particles (FCN190 and FCN210). For instance, while 77% of the FCN190 was recovered after passing through a fine‐sand packed column, only 23% of the FCN250 was recovered. Second, sand surface area significantly impacts FCN recovery. A 17‐fold increase in sand surface area yields a 30% decrease in the recovery of FCN210. Third, no significant difference in the mass recovery of the FCNs was observed between the unsaturated and saturated conditions, which is attributed to the small size of the FCNs relative to the water film thickness surrounding sand grains. Fourth, the particle transport model in HYDRUS‐1D successfully simulated FCN transport, showing approximately a 10‐fold increase in the attachment coefficient for hydrophobic FCNs. In summary, through experiments and modeling, we show that hydrophobicity is a major factor impacting FCN transport.

Here, we update the latest release of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT+), a widely used watershed management model, to better represent in‐stream P retention and remobilization (SWAT+PR&amp;R). We add new streambed pools where P is stored and tracked, and we incorporate three new processes driving in‐stream P dynamics: (1) deposition and resuspension of sediment‐associated P, (2) diffusion of dissolved P between the water column and streambed, and (3) adsorption and desorption of mineral P.

In the Water Resources category of the Web of Science, a thorough investigation of the reliability of this metric is lacking. This study analyzed the citation records of the top 10 journals from 2002 through 2021 for the last two decades. Important to note, there are inconsistencies in the Web of Science database. Contradictory to many fields, few papers are uncited. However, the Simpson paradox applies.

Additionally, most currently very highly cited papers were relatively uncited when they were used in the IF calculation. This raises doubt about the usefulness of this metric. For a limited number of journals, papers from individual nations strongly influence the IF. Also, for a few journals, the IFs are strongly influenced by review papers, but leaving these out of the IF does change the top 3 and 10 of the rankings.

Most hydrologic models rely on observed runoff for calibration, and have limited applicability in the poorly gauged Asian water towers. To overcome such limitations, here we propose a novel data‐driven model, SM2R (Soil Moisture to Runoff), to simulate monthly runoff based on soil moisture dynamics using reanalysis forcing data. The SM2R model was applied and examined in 20 drainage basins across seven Asian water towers during the past four decades of 1981‒2020. Without invoking any observations for calibration, the overall good performance of SM2R‐derived runoff (correlation coefficient ≥ 0.74 and normalized root mean square error ≤ 0.22 compared to observed runoff at 20 gauges) suggests considerable potential for runoff simulation in poorly gauged basins. Even though the SM2R model is forced by ERA5‐Land (ERA5L) reanalysis data, it largely outperforms the ERA5L‐estimated runoff across the seven Asian water towers, particularly in basins with widely distributed glaciers and frozen soil. The SM2R approach is highly promising for constraining hydrologic variables from soil moisture information. Our results provide valuable insights for not only long‐term runoff estimation over key Asian basins, but also understanding hydrologic processes across poorly gauged regions globally.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Almost two billion people depend on freshwater provided by the Asian water towers, yet long-term runoff estimation is challenging in this high-mountain region with a harsh environment and scarce observations.

Although the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) has shown promise in the context of operational forecasting, it is limited by its intrinsic instability caused by the loss of positive semi‐definiteness of the covariance matrix. Effective methods for tackling this problem have not been seen in the literature. The cubature Kalman filter (CKF) is a powerful nonlinear filter for state estimation, which has received little attention in the hydrologic context. In this paper, to overcome the instability problem of the UKF, a new modified UKF (UKF‐M) is proposed by modifying the default UKF tuning strategy, and a novel nonlinear filter (CKF) is introduced to update the states of hydrological models. The methods are tested using a lumped hydrological model. The results of the stability experiment suggest that both the UKF‐M and CKF can overcome the instability problem, while the original UKF can fail due to the loss of positive semi‐definiteness of the covariance matrix. The results of a reforecast experiment in an operational context show that both filters can improve the forecast performance by updating the model state based on the observed discharge, with the UKF‐M achieving better forecast performances. The UKF‐M and CKF can be used to overcome the instability problem of the original UKF and are valuable methods for improving forecast performances of hydrological models by state updating.

Although the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) has shown promise in the context of operational forecasting, it is limited by its intrinsic instability caused by the loss of positive semi-definiteness of the covariance matrix. Effective methods for tackling this problem have not been seen in the literature.

The understanding of canopies&#39; Submergence‐Ratio (SR = stem height/water depth) influence on suspended sediment transport is still limited. Thus, Large Eddy Simulations coupled with the Discrete Phase Method are used to investigate the particles&#39; three‐dimensional distribution in a partially vegetated straight channel. The spanwise distribution of particles are quantified by the probability density function (PDF), showing a non‐uniformity of particles in time as quantified by the PDF variance. We found that (a) with SR rising, the particles&#39; depletion effects exerted by the vegetation‐side mixing layer is improved along the interface between vegetated and vegetation‐side bare channel region. However, the SR has little effect on the variance of the particles&#39; PDF in the spanwise direction when the mixing layer is fully developed. (b) During the developing stage of the over‐canopy mixing layer, submerged vegetation with higher SR gains a stronger upwards (vertical) entrainment capability. The case (SR = 60%) has a higher sediment concentration than other cases in the fully developed vertical mixing layer region over canopy. (c) The vertical suspension of particles in the vegetation‐side bare channel region is analyzed. Particles migrating from the vegetated region are entrained into the vegetation‐side bare channel region by turbulent structures. Nevertheless, the vertical concentration profile is more uniform in the vegetated region than in the vegetation‐side bare channel at the same streamwise location. The cases SR = 40% and 60% still have higher sediment concentration than other cases in the vegetation‐side bare channel&#39;s upper region.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Riparian or aquatic vegetation thrives with seasons.

However, most existing budget closure correction methods (BCCs) are significantly affected by errors in the budget‐component products. Moreover, these existing BCCs do not fully account for the preselection of high‐precision input data sets before enforcing the water budget closure, resulting in uncertainties in the budget‐corrected data sets. In this study, a two‐step method was proposed to enforce the water budget closure of satellite‐based hydrological products. First, high‐precision budget‐component data sets were selected and second, the water budget closure of the selected high‐precision data sets was then enforced by proposing an improved BCC strategy, that is, the Minimized Series Deviation method (MSD). The performance of the proposed two‐step method was verified in 24 global basins by comparing it to three existing BCCs of varying complexity, that is, Proportional Redistribution (PR), Constrained Kalman Filter (CKF), and Multiple Collocation (MCL). The results showed that compared to the existing BCCs, the proposed two‐step method significantly improved the accuracy of budget‐corrected data sets in the range of 2%–19% (statistical analysis was based root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) with estimated observation (EO) as a reference). This study also summarized the main factors influencing the performance of the existing BCCs and their further development prospects based on the results. This provides insight into the expansion of theories and methods related to closing the terrestrial water budget.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Enforcing terrestrial water budget closure is critical for obtaining consistent data sets of budget components to understand the changes and availability of water resources over time.

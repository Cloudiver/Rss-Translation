Here we introduce a diagnostic framework that accounts for observations to assess the sources of skill and infer the seasonal importance of assimilated and forcing data. We test the framework with a forcing data set from a downscaled Global Circulation Model and assimilate four Earth Observation and two in situ data sets to initialize the forecasts. We investigate the hydrological response and seasonal predictions over a Swedish snowmelt‐dominated catchment using the HYPE model over 2001‐2015. The framework allows assessing the improvement in seasonal skill due to the different assimilated data and meteorological forcing. For the studied catchment, all Earth Observation and in situ data sets add information to the final forecast. The lead times during which data assimilation influences forecast skill also differ between data sets and seasons eg, assimilating snow water equivalent impacts the forecast for more than 20 weeks during winter. Lastly, assimilated data sets are generally more important to streamflow forecasting skill than meteorological forcing in the studied snow‐dominated catchment.

Recent advances have enabled the assimilation of data sets of different physical variables into hydrological models to better estimate states and fluxes. Along with the meteorological forcings, the assimilated data exert controls on forecasts; it is therefore important to apportion the contributions from the forcing and assimilated data.

While the structure of BBL above bare sediment beds has been well studied, little is known about the complex near‐bed flow structure within aquatic vegetation. In this study, we used high‐resolution laboratory measurements and numerical Large Eddy Simulations to investigate the near‐bed mean and turbulent flow properties within staggered‐ordered emergent vegetation under a wide range of flow conditions and densities. There is strong spatial variability of key near‐bed flow characteristics on the scale of the vegetation elements. Measurement locations that provide single‐point flow characteristics closest to the spatially averaged values were identified. The spatially averaged BBL thickness is influenced strongly by vegetation density. This impact of vegetation density is engendered through its direct control of near‐bed turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), which in turn is negatively correlated with BBL thickness, both locally in a given flow and across the range of flow conditions studied here. A model based on the near‐bed TKE is developed to predict the BBL thickness and, ultimately, the bed shear stress. Model predictions were in close agreement with the experimental and numerical results. These findings provide new insights into the physical links between near‐bed flow variables and therefore contribute to the understanding of some of the complex biophysical processes present in vegetated flows.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The structure of the bottom boundary layer (BBL) in aquatic flows influences a range of biophysical processes, including sediment transport, hyporheic exchange, and biofilm formation.

This study, therefore, developed a long‐term drought forecasting model using Burg entropy spectral analysis with the maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform across the continental United States (CONUS).

The lead‐time with an acceptable accuracy was affected by how the model parameterized low‐frequency structure of scPDSI that was significantly correlated to sea surface temperature climate mode. The correlation between low‐frequency signals and Niño‐3.4 tended to be weaker for the regions located at higher elevations. Thus, higher variability in spectral structures of low‐frequency signals at higher elevation‐regions led to shorter memory/persistency of time series that shortened the forecast lead time. Besides, higher variability in precipitation linked to the variability of scPDIS also shortened the forecast lead time. To appraise the applicability of the suggested forecast model to drought management planning, drought characteristics (ie, severity, duration, and area) were obtained by the three‐dimensional drought clustering algorithm for the forecasted and observed scPDSI.

Previous analyses of point and gridded annual global precipitation datasets have concluded that LTP in precipitation is weak (H ∼ 0.6) which is inconsistent with higher values of H for large river basins, for example, the Nile. Based on an analysis of gridded annual precipitation data for eight selected regions distributed across the globe, an important new finding is that H increases with the spatial scale of averaging, with mean H values at the grid and regional scale of 0.66 and 0.83, respectively. The discovery of enhanced LTP at the regional scale of averaging of precipitation has important implications for characterizing the severity of regional droughts, as well as LTP in the annual flows of large rivers and recharge to major aquifers. Teleconnections with known modes of low frequency variability in the global climate system are demonstrated using correlation analysis and stepwise regression. Despite having several constituent regions exhibiting LTP, the Northern Hemisphere surprisingly has no LTP; this is shown to result from different modes of low frequency climatic variability canceling each other out. LTP for the Southern Hemisphere is moderate, and weak for Global average precipitation. LTP in Blue Nile basin scale precipitation is shown to explain the Hurst Phenomenon in naturalized annual flows for the River Nile, more than 70 years after its discovery by Hurst.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Precipitation deficits are the main physical drivers of droughts across the globe, and their level of persistence can be characterized by the Hurst coefficient &lt;i>;H&lt;/i>; (0.5 &amp;lt; &lt;i>;H&lt;/i>; &amp;lt; 1), with high &lt;i>;H&lt;/i>; indicating strong long-term persistence (LTP).

Although streamflow signals result from processes with different frequencies, they can be “sparse” or have a “lower‐dimensional” representation in a transformed feature space. In such cases, if this appropriate feature space can be identified from streamflow data in gauged watersheds by dimensionality reduction, streamflow in poorly gauged watersheds can be predicted with a few measurements taken. This study utilized this framework, named data‐driven sparse sensing (DSS), to predict daily‐scale streamflow in 543 watersheds across the contiguous United States. A tailored library of features was extracted from streamflow training data in watersheds within the same climatic region, and this feature space was used to reconstruct streamflow in poorly gauged watersheds and identify the optimal timings for measurement. Among different regions, streamflow in snowmelt‐dominated and baseflow‐dominated watersheds (eg, Rocky Mountains) was more effectively predicted with fewer streamflow measurements taken. The prediction efficiency in some rainfall‐dominated regions, for example, New England and the Pacific coast, increased significantly with an increasing number of measurements. The spatial variability of prediction efficiency can be attributed to the process‐driven mechanisms and the dimensionality of watershed dynamics. Storage‐dominated systems are lower‐dimensional and more predictable than rainfall‐dominated systems. Measurements taken during periods with large streamflow magnitudes and/or variances are more informative and lead to better predictions. This study demonstrates that DSS can be an especially useful technique to integrate ground‐based measurements with remotely sensed data for streamflow prediction, sensor placement, and watershed classification.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Many rivers and streams are ungauged or poorly gauged and predicting streamflow in such watersheds is challenging.

Simulations were run at an hourly 30‐m resolution between 2012 and 2019 and evaluated against US Climate Reference Network measurements. The results show that state‐of‐the‐art soil properties maps (POLARIS and SoilGrids250m V2.0) improve the accuracy of simulated surface soil moisture when compared to the STATSGO‐derived CONUS‐SOIL map. Contemporary pedotransfer functions (multi‐linear regression and Artificial Neural Networks‐based) also improve model performance in comparison to the lookup table‐derived soil parameterization schemes. The addition of vertical heterogeneity to the soil properties further improves the mean Kling‐Gupta efficiency by 0.04 and lowers the mean Root mean square error by 0.003 over the CONUS.

To understand the response of both types of glaciers to climate change, this study developed a hybrid modeling approach suited to data‐sparse regions, and applied the proposed approach to the Parlung No. 94 Glacier (a maritime glacier) and the Dongkemadi Glacier (a continental glacier) to project glacier change under climate change.

The proposed model sheds light on the quantitative effects of freezing rate, liquid water transfer, and pore shape on the freezing deformation of porous media, which can provide insights into the freezing resistance mechanism of porous media.&lt;/p>;</content:encoded><dc:creator> Weiqi Guo, Fengjuan Wang, Yang Wu, Jinyang Jiang, Wenxiang Xu</dc:creator><category> Research Article</category><dc:title> New Insights Into Freezing Behavior of Saturated and Air‐Entrained Porous Media via a Micromechanics‐Based Thermo‐Hydro‐Mechanical Model</dc:title><dc:identifier> 10.1029/2022WR034211</dc:identifier><prism:publicationname> Water Resources Research</prism:publicationname><prism:doi> 10.1029/2022WR034211</prism:doi><prism:url> https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022WR034211?af=R</prism:url><prism:section> Research Article</prism:section><prism:volume> 59</prism:volume><prism:number> 4个</prism:number></item><item><link/>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022WR032559?af=R<pubDate> Thu, 06 Apr 2023 06:28:13 -0700</pubDate><dc:date> 2023-04-06T06:28:13-07:00</dc:date><source url="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/19447973?af=R"/> Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents<prism:coverdate> Sat, 01 Apr 2023 00:00:00 -0700</prism:coverdate><prism:coverdisplaydate> Sat, 01 Apr 2023 00:00:00 -0700</prism:coverdisplaydate><guid ispermalink="false"> 10.1029/2022WR032559</guid><title> An Economic Model of Spatial and Temporal Water Trade in the Australian Southern Murray‐Darling Basin</title><description> Water Resources Research, Volume 59, Issue 4, April 2023.</description><dc:description> Abstract Within the Australian southern Murray‐Darling Basin (sMDB) water markets have become a key institutional response to water scarcity and environmental problems. These markets facilitate trading of water among many users and across multiple connected regions. Increasingly, these markets also support intertemporal transfers via the carryover of user water allocations within public water storages. While trading can improve the spatial allocation of water, carryover can improve the temporal allocation by ensuring storage reserves reflect prevailing user preferences. This paper presents an economic model of water markets and irrigated agriculture in the sMDB. A reduced‐form statistical model of water demand is estimated using historical irrigation and water market data. This statistical model is placed within an economic partial‐equilibrium framework accounting for both interregional trade and interyear carryover. The model is solved numerically for a dynamic market equilibrium given assumptions over future stochastic water supplies. Out‐of‐sample tests show the model can realistically simulate water market prices and irrigation activity across the basin. The model is applied to estimate the economic benefits of interregional water trading and interyear carryover. Results show around a third of the economic benefits of water markets in the region can be attributed to interyear carryover.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Within the Australian southern Murray-Darling Basin (sMDB) water markets have become a key institutional response to water scarcity and environmental problems.

SWOT discharge products (available approximately 1 year after launch) will provide discharge for all river that reaches wider than 100 m. In this paper, we describe how SWOT discharge produced and archived by the US and French space agencies will be computed from measurements of river water surface elevation, width, and slope and ancillary data, along with expected discharge accuracy. We present for the first time a complete estimate of the SWOT discharge uncertainty budget, with separate terms for random (standard error) and systematic (bias) uncertainty components in river discharge time series. We expect that discharge uncertainty will be less than 30% for two‐thirds of global reaches and will be dominated by bias. Separate river discharge estimates will combine both SWOT and in situ data; these “gage‐constrained” discharge estimates can be expected to have lower systematic uncertainty. Temporal variations in river discharge time series will be dominated by random error and are expected to be estimated within 15% for nearly all reaches, allowing accurate inference of event flow dynamics globally, including in ungaged basins. We believe this level of accuracy lays the groundwork for SWOT to enable breakthroughs in global hydrologic science.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission will vastly expand measurements of global rivers, providing critical new data sets for both gaged and ungaged basins.

However, its application sometimes requires significant computational effort and presents reliability challenges. The Green &amp; Ampt (G&amp;A) approach represents a conservative and efficient method to calculate one‐dimensional infiltration but is limited to deep, well drained, uniform, non‐layered soils for a single rainfall event. The original G&amp;A model and subsequent advancements represent wetting fronts as discrete objects, rather than discretizing the model domain in space, yielding a computationally simpler model than the RE. This paper describes an extension of the G&amp;A method into layered soils on a continuous basis that we call Layered Green &amp; Ampt with Redistribution (LGAR). Assumptions employed in the derivation include: uniform soil hydraulic properties within layers, single‐valued capillary head at the interface between soil layers, and no influence of groundwater table on soil moisture. Wetting fronts advance due to the combined effects of gravity and wetting front capillary drive in a layered soil profile. Results of multi‐month continuous LGAR simulations of infiltration using forcing and soil hydraulic data from USDA SCAN sites are compared against infiltration calculated using the HYDRUS‐1D RE solver using standard metrics. The assumptions employed in deriving the LGAR method limit is application to situations where cumulative potential evapotranspiration is greater than cumulative precipitation, typical of arid or semi‐arid conditions. LGAR is a mass‐conservative, computationally efficient, reliable and reasonably accurate method for simulating infiltration over extended time periods compared to the numerical solution of the RE in layered soils in arid and semi‐arid regions.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Numerical solution of the one-dimensional Richards equation (RE) accurately partitions precipitation into infiltration and runoff in capillary dominated soils.

To date, it remains elusive whether matric potential and osmotic potential are independent or not and why so, and a theoretical theory for quantifying the coupling between them is still missing. Herein, a theoretical model is developed to quantitatively explain this problem via a lens provided by a recent concept of soil sorptive potential (SSP). The proposed model substantiates that matric potential and osmotic potential are not independent. The increasing salt concentration can notably depress two variables underpinning SSP, namely relative permittivity and electrical double layer thickness, leading to non‐negligible decreasing (more negative) of matric potential in the high suction range, and increasing (less negative) of it in the low suction range. In turn, the soil‐water interactions redistribute ions in soil water, raising osmotic potential especially for clay with high cation exchange capacity. The proposed model shows excellent performance in capturing experimental data, validating its accuracy. A parametric study implies that the neglection of coupling effects can lead to a significant underestimation of soil hydraulic conductivity in the film flow regime.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Soil matric potential and osmotic potential are widely accepted as two independent components of total soil water potential.

To minimize model‐bias, this partitioning must be performed so as to ensure distributional representativeness and mutual consistency. However, failure to account for data sampling variability (DSV) in the underlying Data Generating Process can weaken the model&#39;s generalization performance. While “K‐fold cross‐validation” can mitigate this problem, it is computationally inefficient since the calibration/evaluation operations must be repeated numerous times. This paper develops a general strategy for stochastic evolutionary parameter optimization (SEPO) that explicitly accounts for DSV when calibrating a model using any population‐based evolutionary optimization algorithm (EOA), such as Shuffled Complex Evolution (SCE). Inspired in part by the machine‐learning strategy of stochastic gradient descent (SGD), we use various representative random sub‐samples to drive the EOA towards the distribution of the model parameters. Unlike in SGD, derivative information is not required and hence SEPO can be applied to any hydrological model where such information is not readily available. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, we implement it within the well‐known SCE, to calibrate the GR4J conceptual rainfall‐runoff model to 163 hydro‐climatically diverse catchments. Using only a single optimization run, our Stochastic SCE method converges to population‐based estimates of model parameter distributions (and corresponding simulation uncertainties), without compromising model performance during either calibration or evaluation. Further, it effectively reduces the need to perform independent evaluation tests of model performance under conditions that are represented by the available data.

We analyze the impacts of this diffusive exchange on the response to heat transport, as opposite to the pure advective displacement, which governs solute transport. We focus on the post‐peak behavior where we observe pre‐asymptotic regimes with slopes that differ from the signature of matrix diffusion, which exhibits a decay rate of −3/2. This deviation is driven by the variability of both velocity field and fracture aperture field. We derive theoretical models that predict these pre‐asymptotic tails under three extreme cases that can be related with specific network structures, that is, networks dominated by large or small fractures, networks with highly or poorly channelized flow. These theoretical predictions are compared with results from numerical simulations in different sets of three‐dimensional discrete fracture networks. We determine that the combined observation of solute and heat transport responses allows classifying the network in terms of connectivity structure, and partially characterizing the fracture aperture variability in terms of upscaled parameters.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Heat transport in fractured aquifers is determined by the combined effects of flow velocity heterogeneity in the fracture system, and diffusive exchange between the fluid in the fractures and the rock matrix, which can be assumed as impervious.

Past studies have shown that, even when open, a barrier system&#39;s fixed infrastructure can increase estuary stratification and salt intrusion, potentially affecting water quality and ecological processes. However, surge barrier closures could have a much stronger influence on estuary conditions by temporarily blocking the tidal exchange. In this project, we use an existing regional three‐dimensional hydrodynamic model, with modifications to simulate surge barrier closure and re‐opening, to study the effects on estuarine salt intrusion and stratification of the Hudson River. Across a range of modeled scenarios of gate closure frequencies, durations and river streamflows, we evaluate the changes caused by gate closures, as well as the recovery time to normal conditions. Our results for the Hudson show long‐duration gate closures (three or more days) with low streamflows temporarily lead to salt intrusion and stratification beyond recent historical extremes. Moreover, monthly frequency closures, which could occur as soon as 2070 under realistic scenarios of sea‐level rise and barrier management, do not allow for recovery under low streamflow conditions and could lead to durable changes to estuary physical conditions. As a result, long duration closures and high frequency closures both constitute a threat to municipal water supplies. This study demonstrates a framework for understanding the potential impacts of any proposed surge barrier system and can help improve our understanding of corresponding ecological impacts.

However, the effects of extensive floodplain inundation on saline aquifers are rarely considered and have not been examined previously under controlled laboratory conditions. We conducted laboratory experiments within a two‐dimensional (cross‐section) sand tank (ie, representing a saline floodplain aquifer) and built both laboratory‐ and field‐scale numerical models to examine lens responses to flood events. Three sets of experiments were performed to explore different lateral extents of floodplain inundation. The temporal behavior of experimental lenses was quantified and compared to variable‐density numerical models that adopted calibrated laboratory parameters, showing good agreement. Results show that more extensive floodplain inundation leads to larger lenses (as expected). The sensitivity analysis was performed based on field‐scale numerical models, demonstrating that the floodplain inundation extent, hydraulic conductivity, and dispersivity are key factors controlling the post‐flood recession in lens extent and volume. In field‐scale simulations of floodplain inundation, the entire lens was significantly salinized during flood recession due to enhanced dispersion accompanying higher groundwater velocities, which may further split into several isolated freshwater bodies before eventually returning to steady‐state conditions. Importantly, field‐scale numerical results indicated that the salt load to the adjacent river increased immediately following the flood event, consistent with reporting of the River Murray (South Australia).

We focus on uncertainty in physics‐based urban flooding models. We consider the effects of the model&#39;s complexity and uncertainty in key input parameters. The effect of rainfall intensity on the uncertainty in water depth predictions is also studied. As a test study, we choose the Interconnected Channel and Pond Routing (ICPR) model of a part of the city of Minneapolis. The uncertainty in the ICPR model&#39;s predictions of the flood water depth is quantified in terms of the ensemble variance using the multi‐level Monte Carlo (MC) simulation method. Our results show that uncertainties in the studied domain are highly localized. Model simplifications, such as disregarding the groundwater flow, lead to overly confident predictions, ie, predictions that are both less accurate and uncertain than those of the more complex model. We find that for the same number of uncertain parameters, increasing the model resolution reduces uncertainty in the model predictions (and increases the MC method&#39;s computational cost). We employ the multilevel MC method to reduce the cost of estimating uncertainty in a high‐resolution ICPR model. Finally, we use the ensemble estimates of the mean and covariance of the flood depth for real‐time flood depth forecasting using the physics‐informed Gaussian process regression method. We show that even with few measurements, the proposed framework results in a more accurate forecast than that provided by the mean prediction of the ICPR model.

For instance, most likely calibration parameter values (posterior distribution maxima) at the calibration range limit or with widespread uncertainty characterize poor model assumptions and calibration.&lt;/p>;</content:encoded><dc:creator> Sebastian Schwindt, Sergio Callau Medrano, Kilian Mouris, Felix Beckers, Stefan Haun, Wolfgang Nowak, Silke Wieprecht, Sergey Oladyshkin</dc:creator><category> Research Article</category><dc:title> Bayesian calibration points to misconceptions in three‐dimensional hydrodynamic reservoir modeling</dc:title><dc:identifier> 10.1029/2022WR033660</dc:identifier><prism:publicationname> Water Resources Research</prism:publicationname><prism:doi> 10.1029/2022WR033660</prism:doi><prism:url> https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022WR033660?af=R</prism:url><prism:section> Research Article</prism:section></item><item><link/> https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022WR033879?af=R<pubDate> Mon, 20 Feb 2023 13:38:10 -0800</pubDate><dc:date> 2023-02-20T01:38:10-08:00</dc:date><source url="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/19447973?af=R"/> Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents <prism:coverdate></prism:coverdate><prism:coverdisplaydate></prism:coverdisplaydate><guid ispermalink="false"> 10.1029/2022WR033879</guid><title> Effects of Soil Particle Size on Relationship between Mound‐Puddle Type Microtopography Roughness and Soil Erosion Rate on a Hillslope Basin: Hairsine–Rose Model Analysis</title><description> Water Resources Research, Accepted Article.</description><dc:description> Abstract The effects of microtopography on erosion remain uncertain, and contradictory findings have been reported in past decades, hindering full understanding and accurate prediction of the quantity and quality of soil erosion caused by rainfall‐runoff. In this study, we applied a dynamic wave and Hairsine‐Rose model simulator on hillslopes composed of various sizes of mounds and puddles. For the tested soil particles whose settling velocity is and rainfall intensity of , we found that soil erosion quantity is significantly affected by microtopographic roughness, even under the same rainfall‐runoff conditions. In addition, we found that soil particle size can potentially determine whether there is a direct or inverse proportionality relationship between microtopographic roughness and soil erosion rate on hillslopes. That is, when land surface layer is composed of relatively small soil particles, rough microtopographies accelerates soil erosion rates compared to smooth microtopographies. In contrast, when it is composed of large soil particles, soil erosion increases more on smooth microtopographies than on rough microtopographies, at least under the tested conditions. Finally, it was revealed that the progress of the microtopographic scale armoring process is closely related to the microtopographic roughness as well as the grain size. Thus, to appropriately consider the role of microtopography in soil erosion problems, the processes of pickup, advection, and deposition related to armoring must be physically considered. Without sufficient information on these features, a low prediction accuracy is expected, not only of the quantity but also of the quality of soil erosion. This article is protected by copyright.

We present two alternatives to the two‐source evapotranspiration (ET) model, which utilize a more accurate approximation of the Clausius‐Clapeyron relation (CCR). Model performance was evaluated through a comparison with observed half‐hourly eddy covariance (EC) fluxes. Modeled representations of sensible heat dynamics and the limiting behaviors were also evaluated to identify the causes of model inaccuracies. Our analysis shows that the new exponential approximation used here significantly reduces errors that stem from solutions to the energy balance equations. The proposed parallel and series models are both more accurate than the Shuttleworth‐Wallace (SW) model under the conditions evaluated here, but we cannot conclude that the new models are consistently more accurate over a broader range of conditions. The new models can correctly reproduce several theoretical limiting behaviors, whereas the SW model generates conceptually incorrect results for several important limiting cases in which some key conductances approach both zero and infinity. Importantly, these models seriously underestimate the observed latent heat fluxes at night; the major causes of the nighttime model inadequacies are thought to be uncertainties of the estimated conductances and forcing data errors. The central concepts and processes related to new models are described via plots of temperature vs. specific humidity to explore the theory behind an ET model. Through these efforts, we anticipate making more reliable ET predictions that will lead to a complete understanding of vegetation–atmosphere interactions. This article is protected by copyright.

It is generally addressed using detailed hydrologic‐hydrodynamic simulations or simple, empirically based indices. The former provide detailed results, at the cost of a large amount of information and high computational efforts; the latter are cost‐effective and simple, yet they generally provide approximate results. A promising compromise between the two is the physically based attenuation index , based on the concept of equivalent reservoir; was recently proposed in the literature to estimate the impact of multiple reservoirs located in series along the main channel, based on the assumption of rectangular catchment. In this work, we extend the equivalent reservoir approach to a generic catchment, with any shape and without restrictions on the location of the reservoirs. For an effective assessment of the method, we also introduce the novel concept of Reservoir‐influenced Instantaneous Unit Hydrograph (RIUH); the RIUH can be derived using a Monte Carlo procedure to include the effects of reservoirs on the Instantaneous Unit Hydrograph. Simulations of numerous fictitious reservoir configurations in a real basin demonstrate the potential of the methods in reproducing the attenuation effect. Remarkably, an average error of 3%–5% exists between and the peak reduction of a less simplified reality (RIUH). Finally, we provide a global, catchment‐scale application of the attenuation index, which constitutes an effective tool for the evaluation of each reservoir in managed catchment system and the design or planning of new hydraulic infrastructures.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The estimation of reservoirs impact on flood peak reduction at the catchment scale is of fundamental importance for risk assessment and planning purposes.

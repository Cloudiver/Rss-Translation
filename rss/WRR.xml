Sensitivities for the streamflow performance, in turn, were mostly driven by the soil and routing parameters, with little contribution from the vegetation parameters. The multi-objective calibration experiments were carried out for the most parsimonious parameterization after a comparative analysis of the performance gains and losses for streamflow and evaporation, and yielded optimal adjustments for both hydrologic variables simultaneously. Results from this study will help develop a better understanding of the trade-offs resulting from the joint integration of streamflow and evaporation data into modelling frameworks.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This article is protected by copyright.

How plant hydraulics impacts the predictions of carbon and water fluxes and their responses to drought remains unclear. Here, we developed an analytical plant hydraulics scheme wherein hydraulic capacitances at the leaf level and stem level were considered, and incorporated it into the Vegetation Interface Processes Model (VIP‐PHS). Then, we calibrated the VIP‐PHS parameters using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method and conducted an ecosystem‐scale evaluation of the VIP‐PHS at 30 FLUXNET sites. The results showed that VIP‐PHS improved evapotranspiration (ET) and gross primary production (GPP) simulations across the studied sites, reducing the root mean square error (RMSE) by 0.02–0.27 mm day‐1 and 0.04–0.52 g C m‐2 day‐1 in relation to the empirical soil hydraulics schemes (hereafter, VIP‐SHS). VIP‐PHS decreased the RMSE in ET and GPP by up to 45% and 55% in evergreen needleleaf forests. Compared to VIP‐SHS, VIP‐PHS decreased the sensitivities of ET and GPP to soil moisture stress, and significantly improved ET and GPP predictions under low soil moisture conditions. The sensitivity analysis showed that larger stem hydraulics capacitance better relieved xylem water stress, resulting in greater transpiration and GPP and less‐negative daily minimum stem water potential.

Commonly, the evaluation of CR models does not comprehensively cover spatial and temporal aspects of model performance; thus, the spatial and temporal accuracy and parameter sensitivity of different CR models remain relatively unknown, especially in ungauged basins. We examine the spatial and temporal performance and parameter sensitivity of four CR models with fixed parameters at the monthly scale over the source region of the Yellow River in China. Additionally, two CR models with distributed parameters were selected as comparisons. Because of the lack of evaporation spatio‐temporal “true” values, the corrected water‐balance‐derived evaporation was used as the temporal reference, and the ensemble mean of multiple evaporation products was used as the spatial reference. We find that trade‐offs between the spatial and temporal accuracy of CR models with fixed parameters for basin evaporation should be considered in the application. Although four CR models with fixed parameters exhibited different spatial and temporal performances, their overall performance was generally similar. The parameters of CR models had consistent spatial and temporal sensitivities, and the sensitivity of parameter αe was stronger than that of other parameters. This study demonstrates that CR models with distributed parameters have a promising future in estimating basin or regional evaporation. An integrated spatial and temporal evaluation framework can better distinguish the performance of CR models.

To help inform the development of reservoir operation schemes, we collate a suite of hydrological signatures designed to detect the impacts of reservoirs on the flow regime at large‐scales from downstream flow records only. By removing the need for pre‐and‐post‐reservoir flow timeseries (a requirement of many pre‐existing techniques), these signatures facilitate the assessment of flow alteration across a much wider range of catchments. To demonstrate their application, we calculate the signatures across Great Britain in 111 benchmark (ie near‐natural) catchments and 186 reservoir catchments (where at least one upstream reservoir is present). We find that abstractions from water resource reservoirs induce deficits in the water balance, and that pre‐defined flow releases (eg the compensation flow) reduce variability in the downstream flow duration curve and in intra‐annual low flows. By comparing signatures in benchmark and reservoir catchments, we define thresholds above which the influence of reservoirs can be distinguished from natural variability and identify 40 catchments significantly impacted by the presence of reservoirs.

We highlight here that HAND is limited to producing inundation only when sourced from its nearest flowpath, thus lacks the ability to source inundation from multiple fluvial sources. A version of HAND, known as Generalized Mainstems (GMS), is proposed that discretizes a target stream network into segments of unit Horton‐Strahler stream order known as level paths (LPs). The FIMs associated with each independent LP are then mosaiced together, effectively turning the stream network into discrete groups of homogeneous unit stream order by removing the influence of neighboring tributaries. Improvement in mapping skill is observed by significantly reducing false negatives at river junctions when the inundation extents are compared to FIMs from that of benchmarks. A more marginal reduction in the false alarm rate is also observed due to a shift introduced in the stage‐discharge relationship by increasing the size of the catchments. We observe that the improvement of this method applied at 4%–5% of the entire stream network to 100% of the network is about the same magnitude improvement as going from no drainage order reduction to 4%–5% of the network. This novel contribution is framed in a new open‐source implementation that utilizes the latest combination of hydro‐conditioning techniques to enforce drainage and counter limitations in the input data.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND), a drainage normalizing terrain index, is a means able of producing flood inundation maps (FIMs) from the National Water Model (NWM) at large scales and high resolutions using reach-averaged synthetic rating curves.

Recent studies suggest that the landslides hydro‐mechanical triggering (LHT) model based on threshold‐based mechanical interactions can adequately predict rainfall‐induced landslides. However, this model assumes that the soil‐rock interface is the only sliding surface and cannot dynamically determine a sliding surface above the soil‐rock interface. Therefore, by calculating the wetting front depth in the shallow soil layer and using the limit analysis method, the most likely sliding surface can be dynamically calculated to improve the model. Through linking the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT, USDA) model and the depth‐resolved LHT model (D‐LHT), a framework for predicting shallow landslides in a catchment was proposed in this work. This framework considers the effects of antecedent rainfall, the mechanical reinforcement of roots, and the spatial distribution of soil properties on slopes. The D‐LHT model was applied to the Jiangjia gully in Yunnan, China, to adequately predicted the occurrence time, scale and spatial distribution of shallow landslides. In addition, the present and antecedent rainfall effects on the shallow landslide volume were analyzed. The results showed that the average soil moisture content threshold was determined by antecedent and same‐day rainfall, which affect the timing and volume of the shallow landslides.

An overarching problem for model improvement is that we do not know the geological structure of aquifers in sufficient detail. In this work, we demonstrate that mineral‐water reactions imprint structure in the subsurface that impacts the flow and transport of some chemical species. Specifically, pyrite, a ubiquitous mineral, commonly oxidizes and depletes in the upper layers of the weathering profile in most humid watersheds, only remaining at depths of meters. We hypothesize that variations in concentrations (C) of pyrite‐derived sulfate released into rivers as a function of discharge (q) reflect the rate‐limiting step and depth of pyrite‐oxidizing layers. We found that log C − log q behaviors thus differ in small and large watersheds in the Susquehanna River Basin as well as in selected watersheds in the Western United States. Although coal mining changes pyrite oxidation from closed to open system with respect to O2, patterns in stream chemistry as a function of discharge are consistent with deep and shallow pyrite oxidation zones in small and large watersheds respectively. Therefore, understanding the subsurface patterns of mineral reactions and how they affect the architecture of aquifers will elucidate patterns of changing river chemistry and our ability to manage water resources in the future under accelerated land use and climate change.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;As drinking-water scarcity grows worldwide, we need to improve predictions of the quantity and quality of our water resources.

However, data points in the recession plot, the plot of −dQ/dt versus Q, typically form a wide point cloud due to noise and hysteresis in the storage‐discharge relationship, and it is still unclear what information we can extract from the plot and how to understand the information. There seem to be two contrasting approaches to interpret the plot. One emphasizes the importance of the ensemble characteristics of many recessions (ie, the lower envelope or a measure of central tendency), and the other highlights the importance of the event scale analysis and questions the meaning of the ensemble characteristics. We examine if those approaches can be reconciled. We utilize a machine learning tool to capture the point cloud using the past trajectory of daily discharge. Our model results for a catchment show that most of the data points can be captured using 5 days of past discharge. We show that we can learn the catchment scale flow recession dynamics from what the machine learned. We analyze patterns learned by the machine and explain and hypothesize why the machine learned those characteristics. The hysteresis in the plot mainly occurs during the early time dynamics, and the flow recession dynamics eventually converge to an attractor in the plot, which represents the master recession curve. We also illustrate that a hysteretic storage‐discharge relationship can be estimated based on the attractor. This article is protected by copyright.

The Oregon Cascade Range is highly sensitive to warming and as a result has experienced the largest mountain snowpack losses in the western US since the mid‐20th century, including a record‐breaking snow drought in 2014‐2015 that culminated in a state of emergency. While Oregon Cascade snowpacks serve as the state&#39;s primary water supply, short instrumental records limit water managers&#39; ability to fully constrain long‐term natural snowpack variability prior to the influence of ongoing and projected anthropogenic climate change. Here, we use annually‐resolved tree‐ring records to develop the first multi‐century reconstruction of Oregon Cascade April 1st Snow Water Equivalent (SWE). The model explains 58% of observed snowpack variability and extends back to 1688 AD, nearly quintupling the length of the existing snowpack record. Our reconstruction suggests that only one other multiyear event in the last three centuries was as severe as the 2014‐2015 snow drought. The 2015 event alone was more severe than nearly any other year in over three centuries. Extreme low‐to‐high snowpack &#39;whiplash&#39; transitions are a consistent feature throughout the reconstructed record. Multi‐decadal intervals of persistent below‐the‐mean peak SWE are prominent features of pre‐instrumental snowpack variability, but are generally absent from the instrumental period and likely not fully accounted for in modern water management. In the face of projected snow drought intensification and warming, our findings motivate adaptive management strategies that address declining snowpack and increasingly variable precipitation regimes.

In this study, combinations of different structures – ie, boxes, steps and a new type of subsurface structure (L‐shaped structure) – were considered to evaluate their potential applicability on river restoration. Flow‐3D and COMSOL were applied to simulate surface and subsurface flow, respectively. The performance of the structures was evaluated on the basis of hyporheic flow and residence time distributions. For the structure sizes here considered, results showed for steps (single step, combination of two steps) and L‐shaped structures (single L‐shaped structure, combination of two L‐shaped structures) most hyporheic flowpaths return to the stream after 5 hours and 2.5 hours, respectively. Instead, shorter residence times (&lt;0.25 hours) were found for boxes (single box, combination of two boxes). For combinations of steps and permeable boxes, the values of hyporheic flow per unit width are higher (0.35 and 0.3 m2/h, respectively) than for the combination of L‐shaped (0.06 m2/h). As a result, the combinations of steps and boxes are more effective in increasing hyporheic flow. However, when subsurface structures are combined with steps the resulting hyporheic exchange is dominated by the steps. Therefore, the combined use of in‐stream and subsurface structures separately may increase their benefits for hyporheic exchange, but when steps are the other subsurface structures provide minor advantages.

Therefore, the combined use of in-stream and subsurface structures separately may increase their benefits for hyporheic exchange, but when steps are the other subsurface structures provide minor advantages.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This article is protected by copyright.

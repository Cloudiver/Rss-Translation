Moreover, the normal proposal distribution used in M‐H algorithm can yield narrower distributions for BMA weights than those from the uniform proposal distribution. Overall, MCMC approach with multiple chains can provide more information associated with the uncertainty of BMA parameters and its performance is better than the default EM algorithm in terms of both deterministic and probabilistic evaluation metrics as well as algorithm flexibility.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;As all kinds of numerical models are emerging in hydrologic and hydraulic engineering, Bayesian model averaging (BMA) is one of the popular multi-model methods used to account for various uncertainties in the flood modeling process and generate robust ensemble predictions. The reliability of BMA parameters (weights and variances) determines the accuracy of BMA predictions. However, the uncertainty in BMA parameters with fixed values, which are usually obtained from Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, has not been adequately investigated in BMA-related applications over the past few decades. Given the limitations of the default EM algorithm, Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm, which is one of the most widely used algorithms in Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), is proposed to estimate BMA parameters. Both numerical experiments and one-dimensional Hydrologic Engineering Center-River Analysis System models are employed to examine the applicability of MH algorithm with multiple independent Markov chains. The performances of EM and MH algorithms are compared based on the daily water stage predictions from 10 model members. Results show that BMA weights estimated from both algorithms are comparable, while BMA variances obtained from MH algorithm are closer to the given variances in the numerical experiment. Moreover, the normal proposal distribution used in MH algorithm can yield narrower distributions for BMA weights than those from the uniform proposal distribution. Overall, MCMC approach with multiple chains can provide more information associated with the uncertainty of BMA parameters and its performance is better than the default EM algorithm in terms of both deterministic and probabilistic evaluation metrics as well as algorithm flexibility.&lt;/p>;</content:encoded><dc:creator> Tao Huang, Venkatesh Merwade</dc:creator><category> Research Article</category><dc:title> Improving Bayesian Model Averaging for Ensemble Flood Modeling Using Multiple Markov Chains Monte Carlo Sampling</dc:title><dc:identifier> 10.1029/2023WR034947</dc:identifier><prism:publicationname> Water Resources Research</prism:publicationname><prism:doi> 10.1029/2023WR034947</prism:doi><prism:url> https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR034947?af=R</prism:url><prism:section> Research Article</prism:section><prism:volume> 59</prism:volume><prism:number> 10</prism:number></item><item><link/> https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR035402?af=R<pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 10:25:19 -0700</pubDate><dc:date> 2023-10-19T10:25:19-07:00</dc:date><source url="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/19447973?af=R"/> Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents<prism:coverdate> Sun, 01 Oct 2023 00:00:00 -0700</prism:coverdate><prism:coverdisplaydate> Sun, 01 Oct 2023 00:00:00 -0700</prism:coverdisplaydate><guid ispermalink="false"> 10.1029/2023WR035402</guid><title> Pore‐Scale Modeling of Coupled CO2 Flow and Dissolution in 3D Porous Media for Geological Carbon Storage</title><description> Water Resources Research, Volume 59, Issue 10, October 2023.</description><dc:description> Abstract Dissolution trapping is one of the crucial trapping mechanisms for geological carbon storage in deep saline aquifers. The injected supercritical CO2 (scCO2) flow and dissolution processes are coupled and interact with each other. Therefore, we performed direct numerical simulations in three‐dimensional micro‐CT images of sandstones using the volume of fluid and continuous species transfer method. We investigated the coupled scCO2 flow and dissolution processes at pore‐scale under different rock structures, capillary numbers, and rock wettability conditions. The dynamic evolution of the scCO2/brine phase distribution and scCO2 concentration distribution occurring during the injection period were presented and analyzed. Complicated coupling mechanisms between scCO2‐brine two‐phase flow and interphase mass transfer were also revealed. Our results showed that the scCO2 dissolution was highly dependent on the local distribution of scCO2 clusters. The rock with relatively high porosity and permeability would have more capacity for scCO2 injection resulting in a faster and greater dissolution of scCO2 in brine. The effect of capillary number on the scCO2 dissolution process was related to the range of capillary number. The effective upscaled (macro‐scale) mass transfer coefficient (kA) during scCO2 dissolution was evaluated, and the power‐law relationship between kA and Péclet number was obtained. Rock wettability was found to be another factor controlling the scCO2 dissolution process by affecting the scCO2‐brine interfacial area. Our pore‐scale study provides a deep understanding of the scCO2 dissolution trapping mechanism, which is important to enhance the prediction of sequestration risk and improve sequestration efficiency.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Dissolution trapping is one of the crucial trapping mechanisms for geological carbon storage in deep saline aquifers.

Previous research has described backwater rise due to logjams that span the full channel cross‐section and logjams with a gap between the lower edge of the logjam and the bed. Logjams that fill the channel depth, but not its width, leaving a lateral gap between the logjam and the channel bank, are also common natural formations and the focus of this study. The flow distribution between the logjam and the lateral gap, backwater rise, and wake turbulence are key factors in determining the ecologic and flood risk impact of a logjam. Specifically, relative to a channel‐spanning logjam, the introduction of a lateral gap can reduce backwater rise and increase the potential for trapping particles, such as nutrients or microplastics, within the wake region, but may also promote erosion in the gap. The choice of logjam and gap widths can be used to maximize flow and habitat diversity in rivers, while reducing erosion risk. We present experimental results demonstrating that the flow distribution between the logjam and the lateral gap can be predicted by assuming equal resistance through the logjam and gap sections.

Peatland water budgets, and therefore peat hydraulic properties, are important determinants of vegetation and carbon fluxes. Measurements of hydraulic properties exist for only a limited number of permafrost peatland locations, primarily concentrated in North America. The impacts of thaw‐induced collapse upon properties such as horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivity (Kh), and thus lateral drainage, remain poorly understood. We made laboratory determinations of Kh from 82 peat samples from a degrading Swedish palsa mire. We fitted a linear mixed‐effects model (LMM) to establish the controls on Kh, which declined strongly with increasing depth, humification and dry bulk density. Depth exerted the strongest control on Kh in our LMM, which demonstrated strong predictive performance (r2 = 0.605). Humification and dry bulk density were influential predictors, but the high collinearity of these two variables meant only one could be included reliably in our LMM. Surprisingly, peat Kh did not differ significantly between desiccating and collapsed palsas. We compared our site‐specific LMM to an existing, multi‐site model, fitted primarily to boreal and temperate peatlands. The multi‐site model made less skillful predictions (r2 = 0.528) than our site‐specific model, possibly due to latitudinal differences in peat compaction, floristic composition and climate. Nonetheless, low bias means the multi‐site model may still be useful for estimating peat Kh at high latitudes. Permafrost peatlands remain underrepresented in multi‐site models of peat hydraulic properties, and measurements such as ours could be used to improve future iterations.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Permafrost peatlands are vulnerable to rapid structural changes under climatic warming, including vertical collapse. Peatland water budgets, and therefore peat hydraulic properties, are important determinants of vegetation and carbon fluxes. Measurements of hydraulic properties exist for only a limited number of permafrost peatland locations, primarily concentrated in North America. The impacts of thaw-induced collapse upon properties such as horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivity (&lt;i>;K&lt;/i>; &lt;sub>; &lt;i>;h&lt;/i>; &lt;/sub>;), and thus lateral drainage, remain poorly understood. We made laboratory determinations of &lt;i>;K&lt;/i>; &lt;sub>; &lt;i>;h&lt;/i>; &lt;/sub>; from 82 peat samples from a degrading Swedish palsa mire. We fitted a linear mixed-effects model (LMM) to establish the controls on &lt;i>;K&lt;/i>; &lt;sub>; &lt;i>;h&lt;/i>; &lt;/sub>;, which declined strongly with increasing depth, humification and dry bulk density. Depth exerted the strongest control on &lt;i>;K&lt;/i>; &lt;sub>; &lt;i>;h&lt;/i>; &lt;/sub>; in our LMM, which demonstrated strong predictive performance (&lt;i>;r&lt;/i>; &lt;sup>;2&lt;/sup>; = 0.605). Humification and dry bulk density were influential predictors, but the high collinearity of these two variables meant only one could be included reliably in our LMM.

For example, frozen conditions impede water flow and solute transport in soil, while heat and mass transfer are significantly affected by high thermal inertia generated from water‐ice phase change during the freeze‐thaw cycle. To assist in understanding these subsurface processes, the current study presents a coupled two‐dimensional model, which examines heat conduction‐convection with water‐ice phase change, soil water (liquid water and vapor) and groundwater flow, advective‐dispersive solute transport with sorption, and soil deformation (frost heave and thaw settlement) in variably saturated soils subjected to freeze‐thaw actions. This coupled multiphysics problem is numerically solved using the finite element method. The model&#39;s performance is first verified by comparison to a well‐documented freezing test on unsaturated soil in a laboratory environment obtained from the literature. Then based on the proposed model, we quantify the impacts of freeze‐thaw cycles on the distribution of temperature, water content, displacement history, and solute concentration in three distinct soil types, including sand, silt and clay textures. The influence of fluctuations in the air temperature, groundwater level, hydraulic conductivity, and solute transport parameters was also comparatively studied. The results show that (a) there is a significant bidirectional exchange between groundwater in the saturated zone and soil water in the vadose zone during freeze‐thaw periods, and its magnitude increases with the combined influence of higher hydraulic conductivity and higher capillarity; (b) the rapid dewatering ahead of the freezing front causes local volume shrinkage within the non‐frozen region when the freezing front propagates downward during the freezing stage and this volume shrinkage reduces the impact of frost heave due to ice formation. This gradually recovers when the thawed water replenishes the water loss zone during the thawing stage; and (c) the profiles of soil moisture, temperature, displacement, and solute concentration during freeze‐thaw cycles are sensitive to the changes in amplitude and freeze‐thaw period of the sinusoidal varying air temperature near the ground surface, hydraulic conductivity of soil texture, and the initial groundwater levels. Our modeling framework and simulation results highlight the need to account for coupled thermal‐hydraulic‐mechanical‐chemical behaviors to better understand soil water and groundwater dynamics during freeze‐thaw cycles and further help explain the observed changes in water cycles and landscape evolution in cold regions.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;As climate change intensifies, soil water flow, heat transfer, and solute transport in the active, unfrozen zones within permafrost and seasonally frozen ground exhibit progressively more complex interactions that are difficult to elucidate with measurements alone.

We investigate the influence of knickpoint development and channel incision on flood inundation, channel morphology, and riparian vegetation on the Fremont River in Utah. We conducted topographic surveys (n = 30 transects) and plot‐based vegetation surveys (n = 336) in three 1 km‐long reaches with varying proximities to a human‐created knickpoint. We also developed 1D hydraulic models to assess flood inundation patterns. Our data indicate that knickpoint development affects riparian vegetation composition and abundance through its influence on geomorphic and hydrologic processes. The study reach located just upstream of the knickpoint (R2) had a deeper channel, flooded less frequently, and required higher flows to inundate the floodplain compared to the study reach located 5 km upstream of the knickpoint (R1). Overall mean vegetation abundance (percent cover) was higher in R1 (55.7%) than in R2 (30.1%), and R1 had more occurrences of wet‐adapted (facultative wetland and obligate) species than R2 (198 and 79, respectively). Vegetation in the human‐created abandoned meander reach near the knickpoint (R4) was predominantly dry‐adapted (upland) species. Cross‐reach comparisons and more than 3 m of incision in the knickzone since knickpoint creation indicate that knickpoint development has resulted in channel incision in R2, shifting its vegetation toward more dry‐adapted species reminiscent of the surrounding uplands. This work informs natural resource management practices for habitat in riparian ecosystems and can be applied to rivers in drier regions.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Hydrogeomorphic processes strongly influence riparian vegetation, but few studies have determined the influence of knickpoint development on these processes.

Here, we developed an automated algal bloom surface scums (hereafter referred to as algal bloom) detection algorithm for Moderate‐Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images based on a normalized floating algal index and the Commission on Illumination colorimetry system. This algorithm was then applied to 35,556 daily MODIS images acquired between 2003 and 2020 to hindcast the spatial and temporal dynamics of lacustrine algal blooms in 171 lakes in China. The results show that 103 (60.2%) of the examined lakes have been affected by algal blooms over the past two decades, and the bloom occurrence in 95 lakes showed an increasing trend. The prevailing increasing trends of algal blooms in Chinese lakes were also manifested by an earlier onset time and prolonged potential occurrence period. We found that approximately 80% of the historical algal blooms occurred under calm water surfaces (wind speed &lt;3 m/s) and high temperatures (>;16°C), and we revealed positive correlations between bloom occurrence and fertilizer use.

The Automatic Seepage Meter (ASM) is equipped with a precise water level sensor and digital memory that analyzes water level time series in a vertical tube inserted into a streambed (Solomon et al., 2020, https://doi.org/10.1029/2019WR026983). The ability to infer flux values with high temporal resolution relies on an accurate interpretation of water level dynamics inside the tube. Here, we reduce the three‐dimensional hydrodynamic problem that describes the ASM water level in a variety of field conditions to a single ordinary differential equation. This novel general analytical solution for estimating ASM responses is more comprehensive and flexible than previous approaches and is applicable to the entire range of field conditions, including steady or transient stream stages, evaporation, rainfall, and noise. For example, our analysis determines the timing of the nonmonotonic ASM response to a monotonic linear stream stage variation and explains previously used empirical parabolic approximation for estimating fluxes. We present algorithms for simultaneous inference of vertical interface flux and hydraulic conductivity values together with an example code. We quantify how the accuracy of parameter estimation depends on test duration and noise amplitude and propose how our analysis can be used to optimize field test protocols. On this basis, changing the ASM geometry by increasing the radius and decreasing tube insertion depth may enable ASM field test protocols that estimate interface flux and hydraulic conductivity faster while maintaining desired accuracy. Potential applications of joint parameter estimation are suggested.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;A new approach for measuring fluxes across surface water—groundwater interfaces was recently proposed.

Here, we reduce the three-dimensional hydrodynamic problem that describes the ASM water level in a variety of field conditions to a single ordinary differential equation. This novel general analytical solution for estimating ASM responses is more comprehensive and flexible than previous approaches and is applicable to the entire range of field conditions, including steady or transient stream stages, evaporation, rainfall, and noise. For example, our analysis determines the timing of the nonmonotonic ASM response to a monotonic linear stream stage variation and explains previously used empirical parabolic approximation for estimating fluxes. We present algorithms for simultaneous inference of vertical interface flux and hydraulic conductivity values together with an example code. We quantify how the accuracy of parameter estimation depends on test duration and noise amplitude and propose how our analysis can be used to optimize field test protocols. On this basis, changing the ASM geometry by increasing the radius and decreasing tube insertion depth may enable ASM field test protocols that estimate interface flux and hydraulic conductivity faster while maintaining desired accuracy. Potential applications of joint parameter estimation are suggested.&lt;/p>;</content:encoded><dc:creator> Vitaly A. Zlotnik, D. Kip Solomon, David P. Genereux, Troy E. Gilmore, C.

In this study, we combined the latest Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) And GRACE Follow‐On products with global models for the first time to analyze changes in water storages in this area from 2002 to 2020, and to investigate the effects of climate change and human activity on changes in water storage. We found that SNWDP‐ER aided the recovery of surface water (nongroundwater) with a recovery rate of 9.44 ± 1.65 mm/yr after its implementation, but had little effect on the recovery of groundwater and terrestrial water storage in the water‐receiving area. Before the SNWDP‐ER was implemented, the rates of decrease of groundwater and terrestrial water storage were only −1.59 ± 0.58 and −5.18 ± 0.75 mm/yr, respectively. After implementation, the rates of decrease of groundwater and terrestrial water storage were −17.7 ± 1.27 and −8.16 ± 1.18 mm/yr, respectively. Groundwater decline, accelerated by human activity and climate change, has led to an accelerated decline in terrestrial water storage. Effects of SNWDP‐ER and stringent policies reducing groundwater use, along with largely increased precipitation in North China on groundwater storage after year 2020 need to be examined in the future. Our results have important implications for the management and evaluation of SNWDP‐ER.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The water-receiving area of the South-to-North Water Diversion Eastern Route Project (SNWDP-ER) is one of the most severely affected water-shortage areas in China, and no previous study has been conducted on the changes in water storage in this area.

In this work, these tradeoffs are investigated through a sensitivity analysis conducted in the context of an optimization formulation of the groundwater management problem, which aims at minimizing the groundwater supply operation cost associated with groundwater pumping and desalination treatment, subject to constraints on SWI control, as quantified by the water table drawdown over the well (∆s), the reduction in freshwater volume (∆FV) in the aquifer, or the salt mass increase (∆SM) in the aquifer. This study focuses on a simplified two‐dimensional model of the San Salvador Island aquifer (Bahamas). Pumping strategies are characterized by the distance of the pumping system from the shoreline (WL), the abstraction screen depth (D) and overall pumping rate (Q), constituting the decision variables of the optimization problem. We investigate the impacts of pumping strategies on the operation cost, ∆s, ∆FV and ∆SM. Findings indicate increasing D or decreasing WL reduces ∆s, ∆FV and ∆SM, thus preserving the aquifer hydrogeologic stability, but also leads to extracting saltier groundwater, thus increasing the water treatment requirements, which have a strong impact on the overall groundwater supply cost. From a financial perspective, groundwater abstraction near the island center and at shallow depths seems the most convenient strategy. However, the analysis of the optimization constraints reveals that strategies where the pumping system approaches the island center tend to cause more severe SWI, highlighting the need to trade off groundwater supply cost against SWI control.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Managing fragile island freshwater resources requires identifying pumping strategies that trade off the financial cost of groundwater supply against controlling the seawater intrusion (SWI) associated with aquifer pumping.

A mechanistic coupled liquid water, water vapor and heat transfer model incorporating kinetic phase change accounting for real‐time interfacial area between water and gas phases was developed to predict coupled subsurface processes and evaporation (drying) rates from bare soils. To enhance the model capability to predict evaporation rates, the air resistance associated with the viscous sublayer was implemented in energy and mass exchange across the soil‐air interface (the land‐atmosphere boundary condition [BC]). The atmospheric stability condition was also considered in the calculation of sensible heat and vapor fluxes at the ground surface. This comprehensive model was validated against measured field data from bare soil test plots from a green roof study, during temperate summer conditions in Canada, demonstrating that the model captured the main coupled processes in the subsurface of bare soil during drying periods. A sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the importance of various components of the comprehensive model.

We use the Extended Generalized Pareto Distribution (EGPD) to model the distribution of the non-zero rainfall intensities. We consider three commonly used approaches for building IDF curves. The first approach is based on the scale-invariance property of rainfall, the second relies on the general IDF formulation of Koutsoyiannis et al. (1998) while the last approach is purely data-driven (Overeem et al., 2008). Using these three approaches, and some extensions around them, we build a total of 10 models for the IDF curves, and then we compare them in a split-sampling cross-validation framework. We consider a total of 81 stations at 10 min resolution in Switzerland. Due to the marked seasonality of rainfall in the study area, we performed a seasonal-based analysis. The results reveal the model based on the data-driven approach as the best model. It is able to correctly model the observed intensities across duration while being reliable and robust. It is also able to reproduce the space and time variability of extreme rainfall across Switzerland.&lt;/p>;</content:encoded><dc:creator> Abubakar Haruna, Juliette Blanchet, Anne‐Catherine Favre</dc:creator><category> Research Article</category><dc:title> Modeling Intensity‐Duration‐Frequency curves for the whole range of non‐zero precipitation: A comparison of models</dc:title><dc:identifier> 10.1029/2022WR033362</dc:identifier><prism:publicationname> Water Resources Research</prism:publicationname><prism:doi> 10.1029/2022WR033362</prism:doi><prism:url> https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022WR033362?af=R</prism:url><prism:section> Research Article</prism:section></item><item><link/> https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022WR033061?af=R<pubDate> Sun, 07 May 2023 23:55:12 -0700</pubDate><dc:date> 2023-05-07T11:55:12-07:00</dc:date><source url="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/19447973?af=R"/> Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents <prism:coverdate></prism:coverdate><prism:coverdisplaydate></prism:coverdisplaydate><guid ispermalink="false"> 10.1029/2022WR033061</guid><title> The role of atmospheric rivers on groundwater: Lessons learned from an extreme wet year</title><description> Water Resources Research, Accepted Article.</description><dc:description> Abstract In the coastal regions of the western United States, atmospheric rivers (ARs) are associated with the largest precipitation generating storms and contribute up to half of annual precipitation, but the impact of ARs on the integrated hydrologic cycle, specifically on groundwater storage and hydrodynamics, is largely unknown.

Commonly, the evaluation of CR models does not comprehensively cover spatial and temporal aspects of model performance; thus, the spatial and temporal accuracy and parameter sensitivity of different CR models remain relatively unknown, especially in ungauged basins. We examine the spatial and temporal performance and parameter sensitivity of four CR models with fixed parameters at the monthly scale over the source region of the Yellow River in China. Additionally, two CR models with distributed parameters were selected as comparisons. Because of the lack of evaporation spatio‐temporal “true” values, the corrected water‐balance‐derived evaporation was used as the temporal reference, and the ensemble mean of multiple evaporation products was used as the spatial reference. We find that trade‐offs between the spatial and temporal accuracy of CR models with fixed parameters for basin evaporation should be considered in the application. Although four CR models with fixed parameters exhibited different spatial and temporal performances, their overall performance was generally similar. The parameters of CR models had consistent spatial and temporal sensitivities, and the sensitivity of parameter αe was stronger than that of other parameters. This study demonstrates that CR models with distributed parameters have a promising future in estimating basin or regional evaporation. An integrated spatial and temporal evaluation framework can better distinguish the performance of CR models.

To help inform the development of reservoir operation schemes, we collate a suite of hydrological signatures designed to detect the impacts of reservoirs on the flow regime at large‐scales from downstream flow records only. By removing the need for pre‐and‐post‐reservoir flow timeseries (a requirement of many pre‐existing techniques), these signatures facilitate the assessment of flow alteration across a much wider range of catchments. To demonstrate their application, we calculate the signatures across Great Britain in 111 benchmark (ie near‐natural) catchments and 186 reservoir catchments (where at least one upstream reservoir is present). We find that abstractions from water resource reservoirs induce deficits in the water balance, and that pre‐defined flow releases (eg the compensation flow) reduce variability in the downstream flow duration curve and in intra‐annual low flows. By comparing signatures in benchmark and reservoir catchments, we define thresholds above which the influence of reservoirs can be distinguished from natural variability and identify 40 catchments significantly impacted by the presence of reservoirs.

We highlight here that HAND is limited to producing inundation only when sourced from its nearest flowpath, thus lacks the ability to source inundation from multiple fluvial sources. A version of HAND, known as Generalized Mainstems (GMS), is proposed that discretizes a target stream network into segments of unit Horton‐Strahler stream order known as level paths (LPs). The FIMs associated with each independent LP are then mosaiced together, effectively turning the stream network into discrete groups of homogeneous unit stream order by removing the influence of neighboring tributaries. Improvement in mapping skill is observed by significantly reducing false negatives at river junctions when the inundation extents are compared to FIMs from that of benchmarks. A more marginal reduction in the false alarm rate is also observed due to a shift introduced in the stage‐discharge relationship by increasing the size of the catchments. We observe that the improvement of this method applied at 4%–5% of the entire stream network to 100% of the network is about the same magnitude improvement as going from no drainage order reduction to 4%–5% of the network. This novel contribution is framed in a new open‐source implementation that utilizes the latest combination of hydro‐conditioning techniques to enforce drainage and counter limitations in the input data.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND), a drainage normalizing terrain index, is a means able of producing flood inundation maps (FIMs) from the National Water Model (NWM) at large scales and high resolutions using reach-averaged synthetic rating curves.

This novel contribution is framed in a new open-source implementation that utilizes the latest combination of hydro-conditioning techniques to enforce drainage and counter limitations in the input data.&lt;/p>;</content:encoded><dc:creator> Fernando Aristizabal, Fernando Salas, Gregory Petrochenkov, Trevor Grout, Brian Avant, Bradford Bates, Ryan Spies, Nick Chadwick, Zachary Wills, Jasmeet Judge</dc:creator><category> Research Article</category><dc:title> Extending Height Above Nearest Drainage to Model Multiple Fluvial Sources in Flood Inundation Mapping Applications for the US National Water Model</dc:title><dc:identifier> 10.1029/2022WR032039</dc:identifier><prism:publicationname> Water Resources Research</prism:publicationname><prism:doi> 10.1029/2022WR032039</prism:doi><prism:url> https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022WR032039?af=R</prism:url><prism:section> Research Article</prism:section><prism:volume> 59</prism:volume><prism:number> 5个</prism:number></item><item><link/>https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR034653?af=R<pubDate> Thu, 04 May 2023 08:34:45 -0700</pubDate><dc:date> 2023-05-04T08:34:45-07:00</dc:date><source url="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/19447973?af=R"/> Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents <prism:coverdate></prism:coverdate><prism:coverdisplaydate></prism:coverdisplaydate><guid ispermalink="false"> 10.1029/2023WR034653</guid><title> Modelling microplastic and solute transport in vegetated flows Dispersion of polyethylene in submerged model canopies</title><description> Water Resources Research, Accepted Article.</description><dc:description> Abstract Physical interactions of microplastics within vegetation and turbulent flows of freshwater systems are poorly understood.

Recent studies suggest that the landslides hydro‐mechanical triggering (LHT) model based on threshold‐based mechanical interactions can adequately predict rainfall‐induced landslides. However, this model assumes that the soil‐rock interface is the only sliding surface and cannot dynamically determine a sliding surface above the soil‐rock interface. Therefore, by calculating the wetting front depth in the shallow soil layer and using the limit analysis method, the most likely sliding surface can be dynamically calculated to improve the model. Through linking the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT, USDA) model and the depth‐resolved LHT model (D‐LHT), a framework for predicting shallow landslides in a catchment was proposed in this work. This framework considers the effects of antecedent rainfall, the mechanical reinforcement of roots, and the spatial distribution of soil properties on slopes. The D‐LHT model was applied to the Jiangjia gully in Yunnan, China, to adequately predicted the occurrence time, scale and spatial distribution of shallow landslides. In addition, the present and antecedent rainfall effects on the shallow landslide volume were analyzed. The results showed that the average soil moisture content threshold was determined by antecedent and same‐day rainfall, which affect the timing and volume of the shallow landslides. This study provides a new method for predicting shallow landslides. The stability and simplicity of the model make it suitable for early warning systems.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Predicting the occurrence time, volume, distribution and run-out length of shallow landslides is critical for assessing the volume of debris flow in a catchment.

An overarching problem for model improvement is that we do not know the geological structure of aquifers in sufficient detail. In this work, we demonstrate that mineral‐water reactions imprint structure in the subsurface that impacts the flow and transport of some chemical species. Specifically, pyrite, a ubiquitous mineral, commonly oxidizes and depletes in the upper layers of the weathering profile in most humid watersheds, only remaining at depths of meters. We hypothesize that variations in concentrations (C) of pyrite‐derived sulfate released into rivers as a function of discharge (q) reflect the rate‐limiting step and depth of pyrite‐oxidizing layers. We found that log C − log q behaviors thus differ in small and large watersheds in the Susquehanna River Basin as well as in selected watersheds in the Western United States. Although coal mining changes pyrite oxidation from closed to open system with respect to O2, patterns in stream chemistry as a function of discharge are consistent with deep and shallow pyrite oxidation zones in small and large watersheds respectively. Therefore, understanding the subsurface patterns of mineral reactions and how they affect the architecture of aquifers will elucidate patterns of changing river chemistry and our ability to manage water resources in the future under accelerated land use and climate change.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;As drinking-water scarcity grows worldwide, we need to improve predictions of the quantity and quality of our water resources.

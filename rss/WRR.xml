The Oregon Cascade Range is highly sensitive to warming and as a result has experienced the largest mountain snowpack losses in the western US since the mid‐20th century, including a record‐breaking snow drought in 2014‐2015 that culminated in a state of emergency. While Oregon Cascade snowpacks serve as the state&#39;s primary water supply, short instrumental records limit water managers&#39; ability to fully constrain long‐term natural snowpack variability prior to the influence of ongoing and projected anthropogenic climate change. Here, we use annually‐resolved tree‐ring records to develop the first multi‐century reconstruction of Oregon Cascade April 1st Snow Water Equivalent (SWE). The model explains 58% of observed snowpack variability and extends back to 1688 AD, nearly quintupling the length of the existing snowpack record. Our reconstruction suggests that only one other multiyear event in the last three centuries was as severe as the 2014‐2015 snow drought. The 2015 event alone was more severe than nearly any other year in over three centuries. Extreme low‐to‐high snowpack &#39;whiplash&#39; transitions are a consistent feature throughout the reconstructed record. Multi‐decadal intervals of persistent below‐the‐mean peak SWE are prominent features of pre‐instrumental snowpack variability, but are generally absent from the instrumental period and likely not fully accounted for in modern water management. In the face of projected snow drought intensification and warming, our findings motivate adaptive management strategies that address declining snowpack and increasingly variable precipitation regimes.

For the structure sizes here considered, results showed for steps (single step, combination of two steps) and L‐shaped structures (single L‐shaped structure, combination of two L‐shaped structures) most hyporheic flowpaths return to the stream after 5 hours and 2.5 hours, respectively.

For combinations of steps and permeable boxes, the values of hyporheic flow per unit width are higher (0.35 and 0.3 m2/h, respectively) than for the combination of L‐shaped (0.06 m2/h). As a result, the combinations of steps and boxes are more effective in increasing hyporheic flow. However, when subsurface structures are combined with steps the resulting hyporheic exchange is dominated by the steps. Therefore, the combined use of in‐stream and subsurface structures separately may increase their benefits for hyporheic exchange, but when steps are the other subsurface structures provide minor advantages.

Therefore, it is possible to reorganize and expand a large existing network system from a prior knowledge of its most sensitive parts. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed methodology are investigated on realistic WDNs by comparing the results with EPANET, for both Demand Driven Analysis and Pressure Driven Analysis. However, as of now, an electrical simulator is required to implement the proposed methodology due to the absence of current dependent voltage source model in hydraulic simulators. The proposed network reduction method can be of enormous utility for hydraulic engineers and opens up an opportunity to implement new elements in hydraulic simulators.&lt;/p>;</content:encoded><dc:creator> Raman Balireddy, Anjan Chakravorty, S.

Yet, little understanding exists for transport in rivers in the presence of bedforms, which may trap grains and thereby influence travel distance. In a series of flume experiments with a sandy gravel bed in a large experimental flume, bed elevation and tracer travel distances were measured at high resolution for a range of discharges. As discharge increased, bedform height increased and bedform length decreased, increasing bedform steepness. For all tracer sizes and flow conditions, bedforms act as primary controls on the tracer travel distances. Bedform trapping increases linearly with the ratio of bedform height to tracer grain size, with 50% trapping efficiency for a ratio of two and 90% trapping efficiency for a ratio of four. A theoretical model based on the extended active layer formulation for sediment transport is able to capture much of the distribution of measured travel distances for all tracer sizes and discharges, providing a first connection between tracer transport theory and bedform trapping and indicating normal diffusion of tracers at relatively small timescales. Variable bedform geometry can influence trap efficiency for individual bedforms and the theoretical model can help identify “preferential trapping” conditions.

Despite numerous progresses in modeling flow and transport over the past decades, we are still far from accurately estimating the scale dependence of soil and rock properties. In this study, we propose applying renormalization group theory (RGT) at pore scale. Using the RGT, we determine the scale dependence of effective pore‐throat radius () and develop two theoretical models to estimate permeability (k) in pore networks of various sizes. The first theoretical model estimates k(L) from the and simulated formation factor F(L), while the second model uses information at the smallest scale (L = Lmin) in addition to and F(L). By comparing with 25 pore‐network simulations, we show that the RGT estimates the scale‐dependent k reasonably well. The first model estimates k(L) with average relative errors ranged between ‐53.1 and ‐3.0%, while the second model between ‐1.0 and 14.33%. We also conduct fluid flow simulations in 40 other pore networks above the representative elementary volume (REV) and compare the results of the RGT with those of the effective‐medium approximation (EMA). Results showed that both the RGT and EMA accurately estimates k from pore‐throat radius distribution and formation factor with RMSLE = 0.119 and 0.096, respectively.

Independent of solution type, pumping history, correlation length scale, magnitude of the sill, and location of observation well, the estimates for T will converge towards the geometric mean.

However, these coupled processes are rarely documented through high‐resolution measurements focused on water‐carbon interactions. We collated a state‐of‐the‐art high‐frequency data set throughout a snowmelt and early post snowmelt period, alongside regular samples of stream water, precipitation, and snowmelt isotopes (δ18O). Our study was conducted during the 2019 snowmelt and initial post snowmelt season in a subarctic, peatland influenced headwater catchment in Pallas, Northern Finland. We measured high‐frequency dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and in‐stream carbon dioxide (pCO2). We identified a change in hydrological processes as the snowmelt season progressed and the post snowmelt season began. We found (a) Overland flow dominated stream DOC dynamics in early snowmelt, while increased catchment connectivity opened new distal pathways in the later snowmelt period; (b) CO2 processes were initially driven by rapid bursts of CO2 from the meltwaters in snowmelt, followed by dilution and source limitation emerging post snowmelt as deep soil pathways replaced the snowpack as the main source of CO2; (c) stream carbon concentration shifted from being relatively balanced between CO2 and DOC during the early snowmelt period to being increasingly DOC dominated as snowmelt progressed due to changes in DOC and CO2 source supply. The study highlights the importance of using high‐frequency measurements combined with high‐frequency data analyses to identify changes in the processes driving water‐carbon interactions. The degree to which water‐carbon interactions respond to the continuation of Arctic water cycle amplification is central to delineating the evolving complexity of the future Arctic.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Snowmelt spring floods regulate carbon transport from land to streams.

Coupling groundwater with surface water observations from Sentinel-2 data provides an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate surface water connectivity with local aquifers following intense precipitation events in arid basins. Surface water area and groundwater level data were analyzed for trends following precipitation, including peak lag time, post-peak recession rates, and changes in hydraulic gradients. Results indicate variable connectivity following large precipitation events between surface water change and groundwater level fluctuations in the upgradient freshwater aquifer, whereas the downgradient brine-to-brackish area of the aquifer indicated virtually no connectivity with the aquifer. Comparison between precipitation and surface water response indicate distinct responses based on the physical relationship of the surface water body with the brine-to-brackish area of the aquifer. Lumped parameter modeling of surface water inundation also constrains the possible hydrologic dynamics of the post-precipitation response. While modeled influx to surface water seems primarily controlled by watershed hydraulics rather than direct hydraulic connectivity of the aquifers, the relationship between surface water and adjacent groundwater levels coupled with surface water area indicates that local aquifers are primarily connected to the surface water bodies through discharge via subsurface infiltration. Modeling results imply that the existence of brine-adjacent surface water in arid basins relies on upgradient discharge from freshwater aquifers. Our results further support that marginal surface water systems can serve as a critical recharge mechanism to local aquifers.&lt;/p>;</content:encoded><dc:creator> SV McKnight, DF Boutt, LA Munk, B.

However, the downstream branches of a bifurcation can be linked by a connecting channel cutting through deltaic floodplains. The floodplain connecting channel as a downstream control can affect water partitioning at the river bifurcation and hence the hydrological connectivity of the river network. However, its effects are still largely elusive. In this study, we explored how a connecting channel linking downstream branches affects water partitioning at the upstream bifurcation and water distribution along the two branches. The investigation was conducted through idealized numerical simulations using Delft3D, followed by analysis of the cascading effects on the hydrological connectivity of river networks using graph theory. The results show that connecting channels can mitigate asymmetric water partitioning at the upstream bifurcation. However, this happens at the expense of inducing more uneven flow at the downstream outlets. The flow adjustment is due to the altered spatial water surface slope in the two branches associated with the flow exchange from one channel to the other via the connecting channel. Further analysis of hydrological connectivity shows that connecting channels can generally reduce the vulnerability of the channel network to hydrological alterations, especially changing inflow, by enhancing flow exchange between the two branches. Our results suggest that connecting channels are critical paths for hydrological connectivity, which have important implications for the management of deltaic river networks and their floodplains.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;A river bifurcation is critical for distributing water, sediment and nutrients to the downstream branches of deltaic river networks.

In this study, 3‐D paleo‐hydrogeological variable‐density groundwater flow and salt transport modeling (“paleo‐modeling”) is applied to reconstruct the evolution of groundwater salinities during the Holocene, that is, the last 9,000 years, in Northwestern Germany. Novel aspects of this study include the consideration of highly resolved time‐variant boundary conditions in a 3‐D paleo‐modeling framework, for example, sea‐level rise, surface elevation and coastline changes, development of drainage networks and groundwater abstraction, as well as the quantification of isolated processes impacting salinization. Results show that salinization was a function of sea‐level rise from 9000 BP until 1300 CE. The creation of the dike line ∼1300 CE set the starting point for increasing anthropogenic control of the hydro(geo)logical system: changes in surface elevation and drainage of low‐lying marshes have become main drivers for salinization after 1600 CE when peat was artificially degenerated. Moreover, changes in the dike line caused by storm floods impacted the salinities. Model results for 2020 CE match well with present‐day salinity observations.

The device consisted of a sampling bottle, a measuring assembly, and a platform for auxiliary data management. Five representative soils and eight sediment concentrations were used to validate the device accuracy and application. Moreover, a novel concept of sediment effective density (SED) was proposed. Under SED, a linear regression was fit between the measured and actual sediment concentrations. The results revealed that the slopes of the fitting line were close to 1, and the R2 values were greater than 0.999 for five soils. Moreover, for total samples, the root mean square error (RMSE) and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) values were 5.59 g/L and 0.9996, respectively. Additionally, an average SED of 2.51 g/cm3 was calculated in this study. With an average soil SED of 2.51 g/cm3 and an average soil solid density of 2.65 g/cm3, the RMSE and NSE were 11.85 and 18.50 g/L and 0.9981 and 0.9954, respectively. This result demonstrated that the designed device accurately measured sediment concentration under various conditions. Furthermore, relative to the traditional oven‐drying method, the device could measure sediment concentration near‐real‐time and with high accuracy, which could be useful for researchers with excellent potential. It was recommended to measure the SED in a laboratory or runoff plot because the sediment sources could be identified and obtained.

The role of heat advection on talik development and feedback on permafrost degradation has not been quantified methodically in this context. We incorporate a surface energy balance model into a coupled groundwater flow and energy transport numerical model (SUTRA‐ice). The model, calibrated with long‐term observations (1997–2018 on the Alaska Highway), is used to investigate and quantify the role of heat advection on talik initiation and development under a road embankment. Over the 25‐year simulation period, the new model is driven by reconstructed meteorological data and has a good agreement with near surface soil temperatures. The model successfully reproduces the increasing depth to the permafrost table (mean absolute error &lt;0.2 m), and talik development. The results demonstrate that heat advection provides an additional energy source that expedites the rate of permafrost thaw and roughly doubles the rate of permafrost table deepening, compared to purely conductive thawing. Talik initially formed and grew over time under the combined effect of water flow, snow insulation, road construction and climate warming. Talik formation creates a new thermal state under the road embankment, resulting in acceleration of underlying permafrost degradation, due to the positive feedback of heat accumulation created by trapped unfrozen water. In a changing climate, mobile water flow will play a more important role in permafrost thaw and talik development under road embankments, and is likely to significantly increase maintenance costs and reduce the long‐term stability of the infrastructure.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The presence of taliks (perennially unfrozen zones in permafrost areas) adversely affects the thermal stability of infrastructure in cold regions, including roads.

Talik initially formed and grew over time under the combined effect of water flow, snow insulation, road construction and climate warming. Talik formation creates a new thermal state under the road embankment, resulting in acceleration of underlying permafrost degradation, due to the positive feedback of heat accumulation created by trapped unfrozen water. In a changing climate, mobile water flow will play a more important role in permafrost thaw and talik development under road embankments, and is likely to significantly increase maintenance costs and reduce the long-term stability of the infrastructure.&lt;/p>;</content:encoded><dc:creator> Lin Chen, Daniel Fortier, Jeffrey M.

Inflow and infiltration (I/I) into sewers redistributes slow subsurface flows to fast within‐sewer flows. Acting in concert with connected surface water, redistribution through I/I complicates the net impact of urbanization on streamflow. Elucidation of these processes is key to the characterization and prediction of urban hydrologic cycles. In this study, we collected sanitary sewer flow and streamflow data from 17 sewersheds and 18 watersheds in and around Milwaukee, WI, USA. We compared flow duration curves and baseflow recession characteristics of I/I and streamflow in urban and reference watersheds. Median depth‐normalized I/I (296 mm) was nearly 35% of mean annual precipitation (867 mm), and thereby a major component of the urban drainage budget. I/I flowrates were similar to urban streamflow during high flow events (10th percentile) and larger during intermediate (50th percentile) and low (90th percentile) flow events. Further, I/I recession was slower and more nonlinear in shape than urban streamflow. Increased imperviousness and sewer density were associated with increased high flows, decreased intermediate flows, and quicker streamflow recessions. Sewer density explained more variability in intermediate flows (35%) and baseflow recession rate (49%) than imperviousness (24% and 19% respectively). Based on our findings, I/I takes up valuable volume capacity in sewers, which leads to more frequent overflows and alters streamflow regimes with ecological implications. Thus, I/I should be better considered in the prediction of urban hydrologic fluxes, and the characteristics and hydro‐ecologic impact of I/I should be more thoroughly explored.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Urbanization alters subsurface flow pathways through expansion of sanitary collection and conveyance infrastructure.

The results show that the two cross correlations between the pumping well and the observation well reach their maximums before pumping reaches a steady state. Specifically, the cross correlation between the observed head and hydraulic conductivity is the greatest when the temporal derivative of the observed head does not change significantly, and that between the observed head and specific storage is the greatest when the temporal derivative (the rate) of the observed head is maximum. Based on the results of cross‐correlation analysis, a short‐term pumping strategy for hydraulic tomography is proposed to obtain the spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity and specific storage using the successive linear estimator. Furthermore, this strategy was validated by Monte Carlo simulations. This paper points out that the sensitivity and cross‐correlation analyses report the ensemble (averaged) behaviors of any heterogeneous aquifers, which is not necessarily suitable for one realization. Furthermore, Monte Carlo simulation is suggested for validating any groundwater inverse modeling result.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In this study, the random finite element method, a finite element method with random field generation techniques, was applied to investigate the cross correlations between the observed head and hydraulic conductivity and specific storage at different locations and different times in pumping tests.

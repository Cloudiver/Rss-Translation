The applied discrete fracture network inversion approach is based on a transdimensional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology and it operates with reversible model updates (jumps) that change the problem dimensions, that is, the number, length and position of fractures within the model domain after each iteration step.

We investigate the influence of knickpoint development and channel incision on flood inundation, channel morphology, and riparian vegetation on the Fremont River in Utah. We conducted topographic surveys (n = 30 transects) and plot‐based vegetation surveys (n = 336) in three 1 km‐long reaches with varying proximities to a human‐created knickpoint. We also developed 1D hydraulic models to assess flood inundation patterns. Our data indicate that knickpoint development affects riparian vegetation composition and abundance through its influence on geomorphic and hydrologic processes. The study reach located just upstream of the knickpoint (R2) had a deeper channel, flooded less frequently, and required higher flows to inundate the floodplain compared to the study reach located 5 km upstream of the knickpoint (R1). Overall mean vegetation abundance (percent cover) was higher in R1 (55.7%) than in R2 (30.1%), and R1 had more occurrences of wet‐adapted (facultative wetland and obligate) species than R2 (198 and 79, respectively). Vegetation in the human‐created abandoned meander reach near the knickpoint (R4) was predominantly dry‐adapted (upland) species. Cross‐reach comparisons and more than 3 m of incision in the knickzone since knickpoint creation indicate that knickpoint development has resulted in channel incision in R2, shifting its vegetation toward more dry‐adapted species reminiscent of the surrounding uplands. This work informs natural resource management practices for habitat in riparian ecosystems and can be applied to rivers in drier regions.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Hydrogeomorphic processes strongly influence riparian vegetation, but few studies have determined the influence of knickpoint development on these processes.

In this study, we combined the latest Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) And GRACE Follow‐On products with global models for the first time to analyze changes in water storages in this area from 2002 to 2020, and to investigate the effects of climate change and human activity on changes in water storage.

Before the SNWDP‐ER was implemented, the rates of decrease of groundwater and terrestrial water storage were only −1.59 ± 0.58 and −5.18 ± 0.75 mm/yr, respectively. After implementation, the rates of decrease of groundwater and terrestrial water storage were −17.7 ± 1.27 and −8.16 ± 1.18 mm/yr, respectively. Groundwater decline, accelerated by human activity and climate change, has led to an accelerated decline in terrestrial water storage.

In this work, these tradeoffs are investigated through a sensitivity analysis conducted in the context of an optimization formulation of the groundwater management problem, which aims at minimizing the groundwater supply operation cost associated with groundwater pumping and desalination treatment, subject to constraints on SWI control, as quantified by the water table drawdown over the well (∆s), the reduction in freshwater volume (∆FV) in the aquifer, or the salt mass increase (∆SM) in the aquifer. This study focuses on a simplified two‐dimensional model of the San Salvador Island aquifer (Bahamas). Pumping strategies are characterized by the distance of the pumping system from the shoreline (WL), the abstraction screen depth (D) and overall pumping rate (Q), constituting the decision variables of the optimization problem. We investigate the impacts of pumping strategies on the operation cost, ∆s, ∆FV and ∆SM. Findings indicate increasing D or decreasing WL reduces ∆s, ∆FV and ∆SM, thus preserving the aquifer hydrogeologic stability, but also leads to extracting saltier groundwater, thus increasing the water treatment requirements, which have a strong impact on the overall groundwater supply cost. From a financial perspective, groundwater abstraction near the island center and at shallow depths seems the most convenient strategy.

This study investigates island groundwater dynamics and salinization over multiple timescales in response to marine, atmospheric, and morphologic drivers. New geophysical and hydrological data sets were collected on a remote sand island in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean between 2020 and 2022 and compared to historical baseline data from the 1970s. Data reveal saltwater intrusion due to multi‐decadal erosion, seasonal climate patterns, tidal forcing, and episodic flooding from Atlantic hurricanes. Long‐term dune erosion has caused the freshwater lens to thin and become asymmetrical; however, a lagged groundwater response causes the freshwater lens to be in disequilibrium with present island morphology. The maximum vertical lens thickness is seasonally constant, but the lateral transition zone along the coast thickens and moves seaward in spring when the water table is high from precipitation and frequent beach flooding. Groundwater level and electrical conductivity along low‐lying beaches significantly increase following Atlantic hurricanes due to seawater flooding, and reach a maximum of 1.93 m above sea level and 38 mS/cm, respectively. While groundwater levels recover quickly, conductivity (salinity) remains elevated due to the short intervals between winter flood events that outpace freshening from meteoric recharge. Results emphasize the importance of multi‐temporal groundwater dynamics and feedbacks between coastal flooding, erosion, and salinization. Field‐based studies considering multiple drivers and timescales of saltwater intrusion are critical for understanding and managing coastal freshwater resources in an age of rapid environmental change.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Small-island populations disproportionately rely on fresh groundwater resources, which are increasingly threatened by salinization from changing ocean and climate conditions.

This study presents an innovative workflow designed to model and characterize preferential flow paths (channels) within rough‐walled shear fractures. A set of 30 rough‐walled self‐affine fractures, all possessing identical roughness characteristics, is stochastically generated. By solving the nonlinear Navier‐Stokes equations in 420 individual realizations, the transition from linear to nonlinear flow regimes and the two extreme flow directions perpendicular and parallel to the shearing are numerically captured. A distinguishing feature of this approach is its comprehensive statistical analysis, which encompasses both the geometric and transport properties of flow paths in the non‐simplified three‐dimensional fractured void space under typical geothermal flow conditions. In a perpendicular orientation of flow and shearing, fluid flow exhibits pronounced localization, with more than one‐third of the volumetric flow concentrated within 15% of the fracture volume. In contrast, parallel to the shearing, a complex pattern of individual tortuous channels emerges, with flow occurring in 22% of the void space. Nonlinear effects primarily manifest outside these channels, suggesting that complex flow phenomena may dominate irregular fracture structures, such as contact zones or asperities. In the parallel case, increased flow rates lead to an amplification of channeling processes resulting in less affected volume and diminished tortuosity of the main flow path, while in perpendicular orientation nonlinear effects are only of minor importance.

The revenue generated from this charge could be utilized to fund reforestation initiatives and support government expenditures, thereby creating both environmental and economic advantages. Based on a calibrated static computable general equilibrium economic model for the Brazilian Mantiqueira region, it was possible to estimate that a water charge policy at a rate of R$ 0.10/m3 (US$ 0.026/m3) could lead to an increase in the Brazilian GDP in the benchmark year by US$ 10.7 million. Economic benefits could also be verified at the regional level, especially in those areas where there are water‐intensive economic activities.

The hydrological processes in these regions are complex, primarily due to the interactions among the river, aquifer, and sea. However, a systematic and quantitative elaboration of the river‐aquifer‐sea interactions is still lacking. Here, we developed an integrated hydrological flow model for the Pearl River Delta (PRD), which contains the world&#39;s largest urban area in both size and population, to gain a deeper understanding of the complexities in the river‐aquifer‐sea interactions. The model performance was validated and cross‐checked via observations at gauging stations and independent remote‐sensing products (eg, soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and total water storage anomalies). Based on the 10‐year simulation results (2004–2013), the major findings of this study are as follows: (a) accurate representation of the tidal effect is important not only for simulating short‐term flow dynamics but also for capturing the characteristics of long‐term hydrological fluxes and states; (b) the flow‐model‐computed average groundwater discharge rate per unit length of the coastline for the PRD is 3.01 m3/d/m, which is comparable with those derived from water budget approaches but 1–2 orders of magnitude lower than the total submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) estimated by using isotope tracer‐based methods; (c) the temporal variation of SGD is controlled by tidal forcing on an hourly time scale, but by terrestrial hydrological processes on monthly and annual time scales; and (d) an integrated hydrological flow model can be used to identify distinct and large subsurface zones sensitive to tidal fluctuations, quantifying the pivotal role of ocean tides in shaping the coastal groundwater system. This study represents a first step in using an integrated hydrological model to explore river‐aquifer‐sea interactions and their effects on the regional groundwater system simultaneously driven by meteorological and tidal forcings.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;River deltas typically have high population density and support a wide range of intensive and prosperous socioeconomic activities.

This study is an attempt to develop a new analytical framework to deconvolve the suspended sediment sources contribution using a novel index (ie, erosion susceptibility index, ESI). The ESI is computed using sediment fingerprinting information, sediment yield, and the areal coverage of the sediment sources (land use). We have used X‐ray diffraction (XRD) and Partial least square regression (PLSR) based spectral fingerprinting technique to apportion the land use classes as sources of sediments in a representative catchment of Chotanagpur Plateau (CP), India (Konar reservoir catchment). PLSR model on the XRD spectra has performed well with R2 >; 0.88 and identified agricultural areas as the major contributor of suspended sediments by delivering 28%–43%, varying seasonally (in the period of 2018–2019). However, based on the ESI values barren lands and human settlements were found to be the most crucial land use classes (with highest ESI value of 1.31 and 1.08 respectively) in terms of sediment generation (22%–29% and 14%–23% respectively) with only 14% and 12% areal coverage. The results have demonstrated that the state of critical conservation urgency of different land uses can be quantified more effectively when combining spectral tracers based knowledge with ESI.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Understanding the origins and hotspots of suspended sediments is crucial for safeguarding the biotic communities and for management of water quality in river-reservoir systems.

A full understanding of the streamflow dynamics and regional water budget is critical to secure water security of the Himalayan water tower. Here we establish a comprehensive hydrological model to simulate the precipitation‐runoff‐evapotranspiration‐groundwater‐streamflow complex in the YZR basin. We decipher contributions of different water sources (eg, precipitation, meltwater, groundwater) to YZR&#39;s streamflow and estimate that groundwater sustains ∼36% of annual streamflow in the YZR, while precipitation and melt surface runoff contribute 40% and 24%, respectively. Combining modeling, observation and reanalysis data, our results reveal a water “imbalance” that ∼31% of annual precipitation and meltwater (∼333 mm yr−1 or ∼85 km3 yr−1) is unaccounted for in the YZR basin. We propose that the “excess water” discharges to deep fractured bedrock aquifers, which is promoted by widespread permeable active structures (eg, faults, fractures). This hypothesis is supported by groundwater storage (GWS) estimates where inclusion of the deep groundwater bridges the discrepancy between baseflow‐derived (shallow) GWS and those derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellite data. The deep groundwater most likely flows across basins, bypasses streams, and finally discharges to downstream aquifers in the Indo‐Gangetic Plain as mountain block recharge. This study not only provides a comprehensive analysis of the streamflow composition in the YZR, but also contributes to shaping a more complete picture of the functionality of the Himalayan water tower, highlighting the importance of groundwater in regional water transfers.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The Yarlung Zangbo River (YZR) is the largest river in the northern Himalayas, providing crucial water resources for downstream.

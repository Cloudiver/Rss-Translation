0.01)。 δ34SSO4 和 δ18OSO4 的贝叶斯同位素混合模型表明，黄铁矿氧化对 SO42 浓度的贡献从 GC 中的 1.7% 增加到 M2 中的 13.6% 和 M1 中的 15.0%。在 ISL 期间，黄铁矿、铵和溶解的有机碳是与 U(IV) 竞争含矿含水层中引入的 O2 的主要化合物。根据这些氧化还原反应的热力学顺序，大部分消耗的 O2 用于黄铁矿氧化 (56.2%) 和 U(IV) 氧化 (39.3%)。目前的结果突出了提高 O2 使用效率在提高 ISL 操作性能方面的重要性。本文受版权保护。版权所有。</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;摘要&lt;/h2>;

In this study, a two-step method was proposed to enforce the water budget closure of satellite-based hydrological products. First, high-precision budget-component data sets were selected and second, the water budget closure of the selected high-precision data sets was then enforced by proposing an improved BCC strategy, that is, the Minimized Series Deviation method (MSD). The performance of the proposed two-step method was verified in 24 global basins by comparing it to three existing BCCs of varying complexity, that is, Proportional Redistribution (PR), Constrained Kalman Filter (CKF), and Multiple Collocation (MCL). The results showed that compared to the existing BCCs, the proposed two-step method significantly improved the accuracy of budget-corrected data sets in the range of 2%–19% (statistical analysis was based root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) with estimated observation (EO) as a reference). This study also summarized the main factors influencing the performance of the existing BCCs and their further development prospects based on the results.

To appreciate the complex spatial and temporal interactions of carbon cycling in flowing waters, ecosystem metabolism (gross primary production [GPP] and ecosystem respiration [ER]) must be resolved at the scale of an entire river network. Here, we propose a meta‐ecosystem framework that couples light and temperature regimes with a reach‐scale ecosystem model and integrates network structure, catchment land cover, and the hydrologic regime. The model simulates the distributed functioning of dissolved and particulate organic carbon, autotrophic biomass, and thus ecosystem metabolism, and reproduces fairly well the metabolic regimes observed in 12 reaches of the Ybbs River network, Austria. Results show that the annual network–scale metabolism was heterotrophic, yet with a clear peak of autotrophy in spring. Autochthonous energy sources contributed 43% of the total ER. We further investigated the effect of altered thermal and hydrologic regimes on metabolism and ecosystem efficiency. We predicted that an increase of 2.5°C in average stream water temperature could boost ER and GPP by 31% (24%–57%) and 28% (5%–57%), respectively. The effect of flashier hydrologic regimes is more complex and depends on autotrophic biomass density.

However, observations of near‐surface wind are typically spatially sparse. The use of these sparse wind fields to force distributed models, such as hydrological models, is greatly complicated in complex terrain, such as mountain headwaters basins.

This approach improves on previous implementations by: scaling to large spatial extents O(1M km2); approximating lee‐side effects; and fully automating the creation of the wind library. Overall, this approach was shown to have a 3rd quartile RMSE of 1.8 m ⋅ s−1 and a 3rd quartile RMSE of 58.2° versus a standalone diagnostic windflow model.

This study proposes a methodological advancement in the so‐called CoSMoS framework, which is a flexible simulation framework preserving arbitrary marginal distributions and correlations, to dramatically decrease the computational burden and make the algorithm fast enough to perform large‐domain simulations in relatively short time. The proposed approach focuses on correlated processes with mixed (zero‐inflated) Uniform marginal distributions. These correlated processes act as intermediates between the target process to simulate (precipitation) and parent Gaussian processes that are the core of the simulation algorithm. Working in the mixed‐Uniform space enables us to make a substantial simplification of the so‐called correlation transformation functions, which represent a computational bottle neck in the original CoSMoS formulation. As a proof of concept, we simulate 40 years of daily precipitation records from 1000 gauging stations in the Mississippi River basin.

We present two alternatives to the two‐source evapotranspiration (ET) model, which utilize a more accurate approximation of the Clausius‐Clapeyron relation. Model performance was evaluated through a comparison with observed half‐hourly eddy covariance fluxes. Modeled representations of sensible heat dynamics and the limiting behaviors were also evaluated to identify the causes of model inaccuracies. Our analysis shows that the new exponential approximation used here significantly reduces errors that stem from solutions to the energy balance equations. The proposed parallel and series models are both more accurate than the Shuttleworth‐Wallace (SW) model under the conditions evaluated here, but we cannot conclude that the new models are consistently more accurate over a broader range of conditions. The new models can correctly reproduce several theoretical limiting behaviors, whereas the SW model generates conceptually incorrect results for several important limiting cases in which some key conductances approach both zero and infinity. Importantly, these models seriously underestimate the observed latent heat fluxes at night; the major causes of the nighttime model inadequacies are thought to be uncertainties of the estimated conductances and forcing data errors. The central concepts and processes related to new models are described via plots of temperature versus specific humidity to explore the theory behind an ET model. Through these efforts, we anticipate making more reliable ET predictions that will lead to a complete understanding of vegetation–atmosphere interactions.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Environmental models are sensitive to inaccuracies in their approximation algorithms, which can bias model simulations and even lead to incorrect concepts.

In traditional partial‐differential‐equation (pde)‐based models that treat aquifers as separate compartments, groundwater recharge needs to be defined as a boundary condition or it is a coupling condition to other compartments. Integrated models that treat the vadose and phreatic zones as a continuum allow for a more sophisticated calculation of subsurface fluxes, as feedbacks between both zones are captured. However, they do not contain an explicit groundwater‐recharge term so it needs to be estimated by post‐processing. Groundwater recharge consists of the flux crossing the water table, which can be calculated based on hydraulic gradients, and of changes in groundwater storage. We introduce a method to evaluate the change of groundwater storage by a time‐cumulative water balance over the depth section of water table fluctuations, avoiding the use of a specific yield. We demonstrate the approach first by a simple 1‐D vertical model that does not allow for lateral outflow and illustrates the ambiguity of computing groundwater recharge by different methods. We then apply the approach to a 3‐D model with a complex topography and subsurface structure. The latter example shows that groundwater recharge is highly variable in space and time with notable differences between regional and local estimates. Local heterogeneity of topography or subsurface properties results in complex redistribution patterns of groundwater. In fully integrated models, river‐groundwater exchange flow may severely bias the estimate of groundwater recharge. We therefore advice masking out groundwater recharge at river locations.

Here, we report the first three century‐long regional summer (July–August) SM reconstruction for the southeastern TP during 1691–2007 CE using a paleoclimate proxy, ie, tree‐ring δ18O. The SM reconstruction, which explained 60.9% of the actual variance, revealed that an abrupt wet‐to‐dry change occurred in 1884. After 1884, SM exhibited a decreasing trend and enhanced variability, and dry summers occurred more frequently. In particular, the variability in SM reached an unprecedented level after the 1950s relative to that during the past three centuries. A structural equation model and running correlation analysis revealed that SM variation was mainly controlled by precipitation rather than temperature. This indicates that the anthropogenic‐related weakening of the Indian summer monsoon played a more dominant role in SM changes after 1884 than the increase in temperature. If the SM variability is to be further increased in the future, it may undermine ecosystem stability and forest health. The results of this study are significant for predicting ecological drought in ecologically vulnerable regions such as the High Asia. This article is protected by copyright.

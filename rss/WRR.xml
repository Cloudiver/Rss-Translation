One important reason is the lack of sufficient available water quality observations because traditional laboratory analysis of water samples has high labor, financial and time costs. Low‐cost high‐frequency water quality data from in‐situ sensors provide an opportunity to solve this problem. However, long‐term sensing in complex natural environments usually suffers more significant errors. This study aimed to develop a novel method to utilize in‐situ sensor data in WWQ modeling, namely, the Bayesian calibration using multisource observations (BCMSO), which can simultaneously assimilate laboratory‐based observations and in‐situ sensor data. Both synthetic and real‐world cases of nitrate modeling were used to demonstrate the methodology, and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool was employed as the WWQ model. The results indicated that direct assimilation of sensor data using traditional Bayesian calibration generated obvious deviations in parameter inference and model simulation, which could consequently bias future predictions and affect management decision correctness. However, after proper treatment of errors in sensor data, the BCMSO method could extract meaningful information from sensor data and prevent negative impacts of errors. The modeling uncertainty was also greatly reduced. In the real‐world case, with 1 yr of subhourly electrical conductivity sensor data incorporated, the modeling uncertainty of nitrate concentration and management cost of controlling nitrate pollution were reduced by 70%. The BCMSO method provides a flexible framework to accommodate nonconventional observations in environmental modeling and can be easily extended to other modeling fields.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Uncertainty reduction in watershed water quality (WWQ) modeling remains a major challenge.

However, the impacts of climate patterns and rooting depth on water age dynamics in transpiration are inadequately investigated. In this study, variations in root‐zone water replenishment are estimated based on stable isotope compositions of precipitation and plant xylem water, and a piecewise linear mixing water age model is employed to quantify water ages in plant transpiration under five different climates. The results show that water ages in transpiration are very dynamic in all climates with a range between 1 and 229 days.

Climate patterns control median (mean) water age in plant transpiration but modified by rooting depth. In wet climates, plants mainly rely on water source that originates from precipitation in the current month (accounting for about 60% on average of their water sources), while plants in dry climates largely rely on water source that originates from precipitation fallen on previous months/seasons. These indicate that climate has profound impacts on plant water source by regulating precipitation inputs, root zone water storage and residence time, and evapotranspiration.

However, these coupled processes are rarely documented through high‐resolution measurements focused on water‐carbon interactions. We collated a state‐of‐the‐art high‐frequency dataset throughout a snowmelt and early post snowmelt period, alongside regular samples of stream water, precipitation, and snowmelt isotopes (δ18O). Our study was conducted during the 2019 snowmelt and initial post snowmelt season in a subarctic, peatland influenced headwater catchment in Pallas, Northern Finland. We measured high‐frequency dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and in‐stream carbon dioxide (pCO2). We identified a change in hydrological processes as the snowmelt season progressed and the post snowmelt season began. We found a) Overland flow dominated stream DOC dynamics in early snowmelt, while increased catchment connectivity opened new distal pathways in the later snowmelt period; b) CO2 processes were initially driven by rapid bursts of CO2 from the meltwaters in snowmelt, followed by dilution and source limitation emerging post snowmelt as deep soil pathways replaced the snowpack as the main source of CO2; c) stream carbon concentration shifted from being relatively balanced between CO2 and DOC during the early snowmelt period to being increasingly DOC dominated as snowmelt progressed due to changes in DOC and CO2 source supply. The study highlights the importance of using high‐frequency measurements combined with high‐frequency data analyses to identify changes in the processes driving water‐carbon interactions.

An overarching problem for model improvement is that we do not know geological structure of aquifers in sufficient detail. In this work we demonstrate that mineral‐water reactions imprint structure in the subsurface that impacts flow and transport of some chemical species. Specifically, pyrite, a ubiquitous mineral, commonly oxidizes and depletes in the upper layers of the weathering profile in most humid watersheds, only remaining at depths of meters. We hypothesize that variations in concentrations (C) of pyrite‐derived sulfate released into rivers as a function of discharge (q) reflect the rate limiting step and depth of pyrite‐oxidizing layers. We found that log C – log q behaviors thus differ in small and large watersheds in the Susquehanna River Basin as well as in selected watersheds in the Western United States. Although coal mining changes pyrite oxidation from closed to open system with respect to O2, patterns in stream chemistry as a function of discharge are consistent with deep and shallow pyrite oxidation zones in small and large watersheds respectively. Therefore, understanding the subsurface patterns of mineral reactions and how they affect the architecture of aquifers will elucidate patterns of changing river chemistry and our ability to manage water resources in the future under accelerated land use and climate change.

Traditional methods to estimate groundwater storage change use a combination of groundwater level and storativity estimates, but there is often considerable uncertainty in these. In this study, we demonstrate a new method that relies on a combination of geodetic data from InSAR, as well as groundwater level and pumping data, to estimate both the total groundwater storage loss and the percentages of storage loss in fine‐ and coarse‐grained layers within an aquifer system. We find that when aggregated over all of Parowan Valley, fine‐ and coarse‐grained layers account for roughly equal portions of the total groundwater storage loss. However, in confined aquifers, fine‐grained layers account for most of the storage loss. This has important implications on the source of groundwater in depleting aquifer systems, as many models do not account for fine‐grained layers as a source of water. We find that in the Parowan Valley, the aquifer depletion is roughly 12.5% of the volume of pumped groundwater, meaning that the remainder of pumped groundwater is sourced from net inflow. This study presents the first method that combines geodetic and in‐situ groundwater data to provide estimates of groundwater storage change that account for both coarse‐ and fine‐grained intervals, which are typically present in significant amounts in the major unconsolidated aquifer systems of the world.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In the Parowan Valley of Utah, groundwater levels have declined by as much as 30 meters over the past 50 years with accompanying subsidence rates of up to 5 cm/year. Traditional methods to estimate groundwater storage change use a combination of groundwater level and storativity estimates, but there is often considerable uncertainty in these. In this study, we demonstrate a new method that relies on a combination of geodetic data from InSAR, as well as groundwater level and pumping data, to estimate both the total groundwater storage loss and the percentages of storage loss in fine- and coarse-grained layers within an aquifer system. We find that when aggregated over all of Parowan Valley, fine- and coarse-grained layers account for roughly equal portions of the total groundwater storage loss. However, in confined aquifers, fine-grained layers account for most of the storage loss. This has important implications on the source of groundwater in depleting aquifer systems, as many models do not account for fine-grained layers as a source of water. We find that in the Parowan Valley, the aquifer depletion is roughly 12.5% of the volume of pumped groundwater, meaning that the remainder of pumped groundwater is sourced from net inflow.

We highlight here that HAND is limited to producing inundation only when sourced from its nearest flowpath, thus lacks the ability to source inundation from multiple fluvial sources. A version of HAND, known as Generalized Mainstems (GMS), is proposed that discretizes a target stream network into segments of unit Horton‐Strahler stream order known as level paths (LP). The FIMs associated with each independent LP are then mosaiced together, effectively turning the stream network into discrete groups of homogeneous unit stream order by removing the influence of neighboring tributaries. Improvement in mapping skill is observed by significantly reducing false negatives at river junctions when the inundation extents are compared to FIMs from that of benchmarks. A more marginal reduction in the false alarm rate is also observed due to a shift introduced in the stage‐discharge relationship by increasing the size of the catchments. We observe that the improvement of this method applied at 4‐5% of the entire stream network to 100% of the network is about the same magnitude improvement as going from no drainage order reduction to 4‐5% of the network. This novel contribution is framed in a new open‐source implementation that utilizes the latest combination of hydro‐conditioning techniques to enforce drainage and counter limitations in the input data.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND), a drainage normalizing terrain index, is a means able of producing flood inundation maps (FIMs) from the National Water Model (NWM) at large scales and high resolutions using reach-averaged synthetic rating curves.

While emerging studies have attempted to build drought severity index based on the cutting‐edge space geodetic observations, few have focused the propagation characteristics of meteorological to hydrological drought using geodetic data. In this paper, using global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) observations together with precipitation data, we systematically investigated drought propagation in the Yunnan province, Southwest China. We first identified seven meteorological and seven hydrological droughts in Yunnan from January 2011 to May 2021, and the meteorological drought was mainly concentrated in northern Yunnan lasting for 1–11 months. By contrast, hydrological droughts were more severe and larger than meteorological droughts, lasting for 2–16 months. The drought propagation time was 2–7 months, short in the southwest but long in the northeast. Water vapor, precipitation, and water storage demonstrated a spatiotemporal pattern of uneven distribution, with the red river fault (RRF) as the boundary, and their phase difference also presented notable regional differences, indicating that the RRF not only influences spatial variation of water resources but also affects drought propagation.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Analyzing the spatiotemporal characteristics and evolution of meteorological and hydrological droughts can reproduce the process of drought propagation, which helps reduce the impact of droughts and improve water resources management.

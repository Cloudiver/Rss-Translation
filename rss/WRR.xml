In this study, optical and acoustic backscatter measurements are combined to a single parameter, the sediment composition index (SCI), to quantify M, mean particle radius by number (ao), the fraction of sediment &lt; 20 µm by diameter (f20), and particle bulk apparent density (ρbulk). Data are analyzed from Chesapeake Bay and five rivers of Queensland, Australia. SCI is utilized to predict the ratio of M to acoustic backscatter under changes in ao and ρbulk (R2 ranged from 0.6 to 0.98 across all datasets) and combined with acoustic backscatter to predict estimates of M that are independent of changes in ao and ρbulk. SCI is proportional to log10(ao) and f20 for SCI from acoustic backscatter measured at 6 MHz (R2 = 0.8 and 0.74, respectively, p‐value &lt; 0.001, n = 133), while SCI(log10(ao)) and SCI(f20) from acoustic backscatter measured at 2 MHz or lower are sensitive to changes in floc fractal dimension. Estimates of ρbulk from SCI are biased by changes in particle size (R2 is 0.1 to 0.5 across all datasets). This study builds upon recent work that derived SCI to quantify composition of sand and mud in suspension and demonstrates the utility of the approach in systems transporting flocculated silt and clay.

Bend orientation is linked to hydrodynamics, bed morphodynamic regime, bank characteristics, riparian vegetation, and geological environment, which are the modulating factors that act specially in high‐amplitude and high‐sinuosity conditions. Based on the interaction between hydrodynamics and morphodynamics, previous studies have suggested that sub‐ (β &lt; βR) and super‐resonant (β >; βR) morphodynamic regimes (where β is the half width‐to‐depth ratio of the channel, and βR is the resonance condition) may trigger a particular bend orientation (upstream‐ and downstream‐skewed, respectively). However, natural rivers exhibit both US‐skewed and DS‐skewed bend patterns along the same reach, independently of the morphodynamic regime. Little is known about the hydrogeomorphology (forced and free morphodynamic patterns) under these bend orientations. Herein, using the asymmetric Kinoshita laboratory channel, experiments under sub‐ and super‐resonant conditions (with presence or absence of free bars) for upstream‐and downstream‐skewed conditions are performed. The experiments with migrating bars (β = 10, 15) are compared with previous experiments where only migrating dunes (β = 2) under sub‐resonant condition were observed (Abad &amp; Garcia, 2009b). Additional, detailed field measurements at US‐ and DS‐skewed bends of different skewness along the Tigre River in Peru are also presented. Conditions at field scale filter out the influence of the morphodynamic regime in high‐sinuosity and high amplitude bends, where nonlinear processes (width variation, bedform dynamics) can directly affect the development of the three‐dimensional flow structure, and consequently the erosional and depositional patterns, and the lateral migration patterns.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Meandering channels display complex planform configurations with upstream(US)- and downstream(DS)-skewed bends.

While nearly 1.5°C of anthropogenic warming has occurred across this region from the 1880s to 2021, climate models show little agreement in the precipitation change during the same historical period, with no trend in the mean of the latest (sixth) generation of Global Climate Models. As such, here we focus on how the CO2 increase and associated anthropogenic warming over the historical period has impacted runoff across the Colorado Basin. We find that the Colorado Basin&#39;s runoff over the historical period has decreased by 8.1% per degree Celsius of warming (°C−1). However, the magnitude of this sensitivity is reduced to 6.8% °C−1 when considering vegetation response to historical CO2. For present‐day conditions, this translates to runoff reductions of 10.3% due to anthropogenic increases in both temperature and CO2 since 1880. We demonstrate that Colorado Basin&#39;s natural flow has been decreased by roughly the storage of Lake Mead during the 2000–2021 megadrought due to this long term anthropogenic influence, suggesting the basin&#39;s first shortage in 2021 would likely not have occurred without anthropogenic warming. We further show warming has led to disproportionate aridification in snowpack regions, causing runoff to decline at double the rate relative to non‐snowpack regions. Thus, despite only making up ∼30% of the basin&#39;s drainage area, 86% of runoff decreases in the Colorado Basin is driven by water loss in snowpack regions.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The Colorado River Basin is an important natural resource for the semi-arid southwestern United States (US), where it provides water to more than 40 million people.

Despite this importance, data that link drivers of hydrologic change to GDEs are scarce. This study adapts a land‐sea modeling framework by calibrating marine models with macroalgal experiments to quantitatively assess impacts of climate and land use change on submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) and subsequent habitat suitability for a native (Ulva lactuca) and an invasive (Hypnea musciformis) macroalgae in nearshore GDEs in Kona, Hawai&#39;i. Lab analyses demonstrate that while U. lactuca grows optimally in low‐salinity, high‐nutrient waters, H. musciformis appears constrained to a salinity threshold and exhibits low growth in low salinity despite high nutrient concentrations. Land‐sea model results predict that while a dry future climate (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 mid‐century) coupled with increased urban development will likely reduce SGD, protecting native forests may prevent further loss of SGD quantity. This prevention thus partially mitigates the decline in habitat suitability of U. lactuca due to the combined effects of climate and land use change. Findings also suggest that, in contrast to the native U. lactuca, reductions in SGD may favor H. musciformis growth if introduced to Kona. Collectively, this study demonstrates the importance of considering multiple drivers of environmental change on GDEs. This study bridges experiments with models to spatially map changes in species abundance beyond their current habitat conditions, and thus informs management actions that can explicitly incorporate future human and climate‐related impacts.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Groundwater dependent ecosystems (GDE) are increasingly recognized as critical components of sustainable groundwater management, but are threatened by multiple drivers of environmental change.

A slow mixing rate between the contaminated groundwater and the injected treatment solution can severely weaken the effective degradation rate. Engineered Injection‐Extraction (EIE) has been proposed as a means to accelerate dilution within the porous medium. However, existing studies on the subject have not considered the potential impact of connectivity and preferential flow‐paths. Neglecting connectivity can lead to an overestimation of EIE&#39;s capabilities, since the fluid may in reality be carried mainly through a few high‐permeability channels, thus hampering mixing and reaction. Due to the fact that channeling can be found in many actual sites, in this work we aim to evaluate EIE methods in both poorly connected (represented as Multigaussian fields) and well‐connected fields (represented as non‐Multigaussians). The approach is to identify, for each given medium, a stirring protocol—defined by a specific combination of rotation angle and rotation rate—which maximizes mixing. To that end, metrics are proposed in order to (a) quantify both the mixing and the containment of the treatment solution within a given remediation volume, and (b) characterize the particle trajectories to explicitly evaluate if preferential paths are broken. The results obtained from these metrics are quite similar for both types of fields, proving that the enhancing of mixing by means of EIE is effective regardless of the presence of preferential flow paths. This study demonstrates that EIE via rotating dipoles diminishes the remediation outcome uncertainty induced by medium heterogeneity.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In the context of in situ groundwater remediation, mixing is vital for a successful outcome.

However, a BME‐based analysis has two main limitations: (a) it does not account for a model&#39;s posterior predictive performance after using the data for calibration and (b) it leads to biased results when comparing models that use different subsets of the observations for calibration. To address these limitations, we propose augmenting BMS and BMJ analyses with additional information‐theoretic measures: expected log‐predictive density (ELPD), relative entropy (RE) and information entropy (IE). Exploring the connection between Bayesian inference and information theory, we explicitly link BME and ELPD together with RE and IE to highlight the information flow in BMS and BMJ analyses. We show how to compute and interpret these scores alongside BME, and apply the framework to a controlled 2D groundwater setup featuring five models, one of which uses a subset of the data for calibration. Our results show how the information‐theoretic scores complement BME by providing a more complete picture concerning the Bayesian updating process. Additionally, we demonstrate how both RE and IE can be used to objectively compare models that feature different data sets for calibration. Overall, the introduced Bayesian information‐theoretic framework can lead to a better‐informed decision by incorporating a model&#39;s post‐calibration predictive performance, by allowing to work with different subsets of the data and by considering the usefulness of the data in the Bayesian updating process.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Bayesian model selection (BMS) and Bayesian model justifiability analysis (BMJ) provide a statistically rigorous framework for comparing competing models through the use of Bayesian model evidence (BME).

Additionally, reductions in snowpack drive earlier peak flows and lower summer flows across the western United States increasing reliance on groundwater for maintaining summer streamflow. However, it remains poorly understood how groundwater contributions vary interannually. We quantify recession limb groundwater (RLGW), defined as the proportional groundwater contribution to the stream during the period between peak stream flow and low flow, to predict summer low flows across three diverse western US watersheds. We ask: 1) how do snow and rain dynamics influence interannual variations of RLGW contributions and summer low flows?; and 2) which watershed attributes impact the effectiveness of RLGW as a predictor of summer low flows? Linear models reveal that RLGW is a strong predictor of low flows across all sites, and drastically improves low flow prediction compared to snow metrics at a rain‐dominated site. Results suggest that strength of RLGW control on summer low flows may be mediated by subsurface storage. Subsurface storage can be divided into dynamic (ie, variability saturated) and deep (ie, permanently saturated) components, and we hypothesize that interannual variability in dynamic storage contribution to streamflow drives RLGW variability. In systems with a higher proportion of dynamic storage, RLGW is a better predictor of summer low flow because the stream is more responsive to dynamic storage contributions compared to deep‐storage‐dominated systems. Overall, including RLGW improved low flow prediction across diverse watersheds.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Summer streamflow predictions are critical for managing water resources, however warming-induced shifts from snow to rain regimes impact low flow predictive models.

However, insights are lacking regarding the control of climate conditions on RLs&#39; performances and how they are affected by different geographic configurations. This study applies a 2D hydrodynamic model to perform catchment‐scale performance assessment of RLs beyond the scope of analytical and hydrological models. We conduct extensive numerical experiments of rainstorm‐induced flooding in a rural‐urban catchment with a constructed RL and blueprinted ones upstream. Results demonstrate an L‐shaped band of satisfactory performance of the current RL in the frequency‐duration diagram, which coincides with short return periods (&lt; 5 years) and long durations (>; 4 hours), or short durations (&lt; 3 hours) and moderate to long return periods (5 ‐ 50 years); such L‐shaped pattern is also valid for additional RLs and their combinations. With the increase in event size, the first two modes of RL performance (out of four) correspond to effective flood mitigation. When working jointly, RLs with series configurations are more effective in reducing the mainstream flood peaks, while parallel connections provide a greater spatial extent of flood hazard mitigation. For both series and parallel configurations, the upstream‐weighted settings tend to outperform downstream‐weighted ones under more extreme events; the decentralized arrangement in the urban area yields more benefits in spatial flood hazard mitigation compared to the centralized case. The study highlights the critical role of rainstorm severity (with possible spatiotemporal variabilities) in controlling RL performances despite various configurations and hydraulic settings.

The equations for predicting the front velocities of downslope turbidity currents with emergent vegetation were proposed and validated via experimental data.

Emergent rigid vegetation accelerates the formation of the reflected bore to provide energy for the deposited sediment to move downstream continuously.

In this study, optical and acoustic backscatter measurements are combined to a single parameter, the sediment composition index (SCI), to quantify M, mean particle radius by number (ao), the fraction of sediment &lt; 20 µm by diameter (f20), and particle bulk apparent density (ρbulk). Data are analyzed from Chesapeake Bay and five rivers of Queensland, Australia. SCI is utilized to predict the ratio of M to acoustic backscatter under changes in ao and ρbulk (R2 ranged from 0.6 to 0.98 across all datasets) and combined with acoustic backscatter to predict estimates of M that are independent of changes in ao and ρbulk. SCI is proportional to log10(ao) and f20 for SCI from acoustic backscatter measured at 6 MHz (R2 = 0.8 and 0.74, respectively, p‐value &lt; 0.001, n = 133), while SCI(log10(ao)) and SCI(f20) from acoustic backscatter measured at 2 MHz or lower are sensitive to changes in floc fractal dimension. Estimates of ρbulk from SCI are biased by changes in particle size (R2 is 0.1 to 0.5 across all datasets). This study builds upon recent work that derived SCI to quantify composition of sand and mud in suspension and demonstrates the utility of the approach in systems transporting flocculated silt and clay.

The suitable habitat area and distribution variation characteristics of GWG and BG from 1982 to 2020 were extracted based on the threshold range.

We quantify recession limb groundwater (RLGW), defined as the proportional groundwater contribution to the stream during the period between peak stream flow and low flow, to predict summer low flows across three diverse western US watersheds.

Linear models reveal that RLGW is a strong predictor of low flows across all sites, and drastically improves low flow prediction compared to snow metrics at a rain‐dominated site. Results suggest that strength of RLGW control on summer low flows may be mediated by subsurface storage. Subsurface storage can be divided into dynamic (ie, variability saturated) and deep (ie, permanently saturated) components, and we hypothesize that interannual variability in dynamic storage contribution to streamflow drives RLGW variability. In systems with a higher proportion of dynamic storage, RLGW is a better predictor of summer low flow because the stream is more responsive to dynamic storage contributions compared to deep‐storage‐dominated systems.

This spatial variability has a profound, yet still partially understood, impact on conservative transport. Moreover, molecular diffusion is often a disregarded process that can have an important counter‐intuitive effect on transport: diffusion can prevent non‐Fickian tailing by mobilizing mass otherwise trapped in low velocity zones. Here, we focus on macroscopically homogeneous soils presenting small scale heterogeneity, as described by the Miller‐Miller theory. We then analyze the dynamic control of soil heterogeneity, advection and diffusion on conservative transport. We focus especially on the importance of diffusion and of its tortuosity‐dependent spatial variability on the overall transport. Our results confirm previous finding that relatively high Péclet number systems are highly sensitive to the degree of heterogeneity, which promotes non‐Fickian transport. Also, diffusion appears to have a profound impact on transport, depending on both the degree of heterogeneity and the Péclet number. For a high Péclet number and a very heterogeneous system, diffusion leads to the counter‐intuitive decrease of non‐Fickian spreading described previously. This is not observed for a low Péclet number due to the impact of the spatial variability in the diffusion coefficient, which appears to be a significant controlling factor of transport by promoting or preventing the accumulation of mass in low velocity zones. Globally, this work (1) highlights the complex, synergistic effect of soil heterogeneity, advective fluxes and diffusion on transport and (2), alerts on potential upscaling challenges when the spatial variability of such key processes cannot be properly described.

However, the operation of large UDS (containing over 20 actuators) can only be optimized by oversimplifying the UDS dynamics, potentially leading to a decrease in performance and reduction in users&#39; trust, thus inhibiting widespread implementation of MPC procedures. A Heuristic And Predictive Policy (HAPPy) was set up, relying on the dynamic selection of the actuators with the highest impact on the UDS functioning and optimizing those in real‐time. The remaining actuators follow a pre‐set heuristic procedure. The HAPPy procedure was applied to two separate UDS in Rotterdam with the control objective being the minimization of overflow volume in each of the two cases. Results obtained show that the level of impact of the actuators on the UDS functioning changes during an event and can be predicted using a Random Forest algorithm. These predictions can be used to provide near‐global optimal actuator settings resulting in the performance of the HAPPy procedure that is comparable to a full‐MPC control and outperforming heuristic control procedures. The number of actuators selected to obtain near‐global optimal settings depends on the UDS and rainfall characteristics showing an asymptotic RTC performance as the number of actuators increases. The HAPPy procedure showed different RTC dynamics for medium and large rainfall events, with the former showing a higher level of controllability than the latter. For medium events, a relatively small number of actuators suffices to achieve the potential performance improvement.

However, the operation of large UDS (containing over 20 actuators) can only be optimized by oversimplifying the UDS dynamics, potentially leading to a decrease in performance and reduction in users&#39; trust, thus inhibiting widespread implementation of MPC procedures. A Heuristic And Predictive Policy (HAPPy) was set up, relying on the dynamic selection of the actuators with the highest impact on the UDS functioning and optimizing those in real-time. The remaining actuators follow a pre-set heuristic procedure. The HAPPy procedure was applied to two separate UDS in Rotterdam with the control objective being the minimization of overflow volume in each of the two cases. Results obtained show that the level of impact of the actuators on the UDS functioning changes during an event and can be predicted using a Random Forest algorithm. These predictions can be used to provide near-global optimal actuator settings resulting in the performance of the HAPPy procedure that is comparable to a full-MPC control and outperforming heuristic control procedures. The number of actuators selected to obtain near-global optimal settings depends on the UDS and rainfall characteristics showing an asymptotic RTC performance as the number of actuators increases. The HAPPy procedure showed different RTC dynamics for medium and large rainfall events, with the former showing a higher level of controllability than the latter.

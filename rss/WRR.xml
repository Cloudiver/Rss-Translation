Based on this review, we point out some important issues that have received little attention, including the quantification of safe distances and the linkages between multiscale water PBs.&lt;/p>;</content:encoded><dc:creator> Siqi Han, Guoyong Leng, Linfei Yu</dc:creator><category> Review Article</category><dc:title> Review of Quantitative Applications of the Concept of the Water Planetary Boundary at Different Spatial Scales</dc:title><dc:identifier> 10.1029/2022WR033646</dc:identifier><prism:publicationname> Water Resources Research</prism:publicationname><prism:doi> 10.1029/2022WR033646</prism:doi><prism:url> https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022WR033646?af=R</prism:url><prism:section> Review Article</prism:section><prism:volume> 59</prism:volume><prism:number> 4个</prism:number></item><item><link/>https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022WR033584?af=R<pubDate> Thu, 13 Apr 2023 08:05:18 -0700</pubDate><dc:date> 2023-04-13T08:05:18-07:00</dc:date><source url="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/19447973?af=R"/> Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents<prism:coverdate> Sat, 01 Apr 2023 00:00:00 -0700</prism:coverdate><prism:coverdisplaydate> Sat, 01 Apr 2023 00:00:00 -0700</prism:coverdisplaydate><guid ispermalink="false"> 10.1029/2022WR033584</guid><title> A Portable Device for On‐Site Measurement of Sediment Concentration Through Volume‐Mass Replacement</title><description> Water Resources Research, Volume 59, Issue 4, April 2023.</description><dc:description> Abstract To enable on‐site and near‐real‐time sediment concentration measurements, a novel type of portable device with a constant volume sampling bottle was developed in this study. The device consisted of a sampling bottle, a measuring assembly, and a platform for auxiliary data management. Five representative soils and eight sediment concentrations were used to validate the device accuracy and application. Moreover, a novel concept of sediment effective density (SED) was proposed. Under SED, a linear regression was fit between the measured and actual sediment concentrations. The results revealed that the slopes of the fitting line were close to 1, and the R2 values were greater than 0.999 for five soils. Moreover, for total samples, the root mean square error (RMSE) and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) values were 5.59 g/L and 0.9996, respectively. Additionally, an average SED of 2.51 g/cm3 was calculated in this study. With an average soil SED of 2.51 g/cm3 and an average soil solid density of 2.65 g/cm3, the RMSE and NSE were 11.85 and 18.50 g/L and 0.9981 and 0.9954, respectively. This result demonstrated that the designed device accurately measured sediment concentration under various conditions. Furthermore, relative to the traditional oven‐drying method, the device could measure sediment concentration near‐real‐time and with high accuracy, which could be useful for researchers with excellent potential. It was recommended to measure the SED in a laboratory or runoff plot because the sediment sources could be identified and obtained. In a field or river, it was recommended to use 2.51 g/cm3 as the SED, which was more accurate than 2.65 g/cm3.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;To enable on-site and near-real-time sediment concentration measurements, a novel type of portable device with a constant volume sampling bottle was developed in this study.

The role of heat advection on talik development and feedback on permafrost degradation has not been quantified methodically in this context. We incorporate a surface energy balance model into a coupled groundwater flow and energy transport numerical model (SUTRA‐ice). The model, calibrated with long‐term observations (1997–2018 on the Alaska Highway), is used to investigate and quantify the role of heat advection on talik initiation and development under a road embankment. Over the 25‐year simulation period, the new model is driven by reconstructed meteorological data and has a good agreement with near surface soil temperatures. The model successfully reproduces the increasing depth to the permafrost table (mean absolute error &lt;0.2 m), and talik development. The results demonstrate that heat advection provides an additional energy source that expedites the rate of permafrost thaw and roughly doubles the rate of permafrost table deepening, compared to purely conductive thawing. Talik initially formed and grew over time under the combined effect of water flow, snow insulation, road construction and climate warming. Talik formation creates a new thermal state under the road embankment, resulting in acceleration of underlying permafrost degradation, due to the positive feedback of heat accumulation created by trapped unfrozen water. In a changing climate, mobile water flow will play a more important role in permafrost thaw and talik development under road embankments, and is likely to significantly increase maintenance costs and reduce the long‐term stability of the infrastructure.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The presence of taliks (perennially unfrozen zones in permafrost areas) adversely affects the thermal stability of infrastructure in cold regions, including roads.

In this study, we collected sanitary sewer flow and streamflow data from 17 sewersheds and 18 watersheds in and around Milwaukee, WI, USA. We compared flow duration curves and baseflow recession characteristics of I/I and streamflow in urban and reference watersheds. Median depth‐normalized I/I (296 mm) was nearly 35% of mean annual precipitation (867 mm), and thereby a major component of the urban drainage budget. I/I flowrates were similar to urban streamflow during high flow events (10th percentile) and larger during intermediate (50th percentile) and low (90th percentile) flow events. Further, I/I recession was slower and more nonlinear in shape than urban streamflow. Increased imperviousness and sewer density were associated with increased high flows, decreased intermediate flows, and quicker streamflow recessions. Sewer density explained more variability in intermediate flows (35%) and baseflow recession rate (49%) than imperviousness (24% and 19% respectively). Based on our findings, I/I takes up valuable volume capacity in sewers, which leads to more frequent overflows and alters streamflow regimes with ecological implications. Thus, I/I should be better considered in the prediction of urban hydrologic fluxes, and the characteristics and hydro‐ecologic impact of I/I should be more thoroughly explored.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Urbanization alters subsurface flow pathways through expansion of sanitary collection and conveyance infrastructure.

The results show that the two cross correlations between the pumping well and the observation well reach their maximums before pumping reaches a steady state. Specifically, the cross correlation between the observed head and hydraulic conductivity is the greatest when the temporal derivative of the observed head does not change significantly, and that between the observed head and specific storage is the greatest when the temporal derivative (the rate) of the observed head is maximum. Based on the results of cross‐correlation analysis, a short‐term pumping strategy for hydraulic tomography is proposed to obtain the spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity and specific storage using the successive linear estimator. Furthermore, this strategy was validated by Monte Carlo simulations.

A peak‐over‐threshold (POT)‐based approach is applied to compute areal reduction factor (ARF) for subsequently establishing intensity‐duration‐area‐frequency (IDAF) curves. Our results reveal that ARF values generally decrease with increasing area size and increase with longer duration and are affected by multiple underlying physical phenomena. Moreover, we find a greater increase in the rainfall intensities for shorter durations and higher return periods, ranging from 9.4% (1‐hr) to 6.2% (24‐hr), averaged for all return periods and 8.3% (25‐year) to 7.3% (2‐year), averaged for all rainfall durations. Spatially, extreme rainfall intensities are projected to increase by 8.9% in northern Japan (albeit with a less intense rainfall intensity in the current period), which is greater than the rest of the country (6.8%), underscoring the need to focus more on infrastructure designs in northern Japan. The projected IDAF curves further display an increase in the frequency of extreme events at city‐scale, for example, 25‐year extreme rainfall events in 2006–2020 would likely be 5‐10‐year events in 2081–2109.

Microwave remote sensing offers a practical way to quantify IWU by monitoring changes in soil moisture caused by irrigation. However, high‐resolution satellite soil moisture data is typically infrequent (eg, 6–12 days) and thus may miss irrigation events. This study evaluates the ability to quantify IWU by assimilating high‐resolution (1 km) SMAP‐Sentinel 1 remotely sensed soil moisture with a physically based land surface model (LSM) using a particle batch smoother (PBS). A suite of synthetic experiments is devised to evaluate different error sources. Results from the synthetic experiments show that unbiased simulations with known irrigation timing can produce an accurate irrigation estimate with a mean annual bias of 0.45% and a mean R2 of 0.97, relative to observed IWU. Unknown irrigation timing can significantly deteriorate the model performance, resulting in an increased mean annual bias to 23% and decreased mean R2 to 0.36. Adding random noise to synthetic observations does not significantly decrease model performance except for the experiments with low observation frequency (>;12 days). In real‐world experiments, the PBS data assimilation approach underestimates observed IWU by 18.6% when the timing of IWU is known. IWU estimates are consistently significantly higher over irrigated pixels compared to the non‐irrigated pixels, indicating data assimilation skillfully conveys irrigation signals to the LSM.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Irrigation is the largest human intervention in the water cycle that can modulate climate extremes, yet irrigation water use (IWU) remains largely unknown in most regions.

Techniques such as baseflow separation necessitate streamflow records and do not directly indicate whether groundwater inflow may be sourced from more dynamic shallow flowpaths. We present a web tool application PASTA (Paired Air and Stream Temperature Analysis; https://cuahsi.shinyapps.io/pasta/) that capitalizes on increased public stream temperature data availability and large‐scale, gridded climate observations to provide new and efficient insights regarding relative groundwater influence on streams. PASTA analyzes paired air and stream water temperature signals to evaluate spatiotemporal patterns in stream thermal sensitivity and relative groundwater influence, including inference regarding the dominant source groundwater depth (shallow or deep (ie, approximately >;6 m depth)). The tool is linked to publicly available stream temperature datasets and accepts user‐uploaded datasets. As local air temperature is not often monitored, PASTA pulls daily air temperature data from the comprehensive Daymet products when directly measured data are unavailable, allowing the repurposing of existing stream temperature data. After data are selected or uploaded, the tool (a) fits sinusoidal curves of daily stream and air temperatures by year (water or calendar) to indicate groundwater influence characteristics and (b) performs linear regressions for stream versus air temperatures to indicate stream thermal sensitivity. Results are exported in ASCII file format, creating an efficient and approachable analysis tool for the adoption of newly developed heat tracing analysis from stream reach to landscape scales.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Groundwater is critical for maintaining stream baseflow and thermal stability; however, the influence of groundwater on streamflow has been difficult to evaluate at broad spatial scales.

In this study, a new approach, which adopted finite difference numerical schemes along with the limited‐memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno bounded (L‐BFGS‐B) parameter optimization algorithm, was developed to inversely trace vertical soil water fluxes in variably saturated zones using temperature‐depth time‐series data. The newly developed method did not utilize hydraulic parameters and only temperature time‐series data were used at the adjacent depths as boundary conditions. The soil water, vapor flux, and spatiotemporal variations in thermal conductivity at a given location were optimized by fitting the temperature time‐series at the target depth using the L‐BFGS‐B algorithm. Further, the method was verified through laboratory experiments under different saturated conditions that were conducted in two columns with saturated and free drainage bottom boundaries, and five sets of different flow rates with a relatively stable flow condition. The soil water flux calculated using the proposed method was consistent with the observed data, thus, verifying the reliability of the approach in applications with relatively stable flow rates. Furthermore, the new method was applied to a field site to estimate the time‐varying soil water flux using the measured temperature data. The trends of the calculated soil water flux at different depths were consistent with the field hydrologic conditions and observations. Thus, this study provides a novel computationally efficient and easy‐to‐implement tool to determine soil water flux using temperature measurements.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The coexistence of water, vapor, and solid phases and the spatiotemporal changes in thermal conductivities in response to variations in water content pose a challenge to the heat-tracing method used to calculate water flux in variably saturated zones.

Recent advances have enabled the assimilation of data sets of different physical variables into hydrological models to better estimate states and fluxes. Along with the meteorological forcings, the assimilated data exert controls on forecasts; it is therefore important to apportion the contributions from the forcing and assimilated data. Quality assessment is sometimes conducted in the pseudo‐reality, which neglects observations and model limitations. Here we introduce a diagnostic framework that accounts for observations to assess the sources of skill and infer the seasonal importance of assimilated and forcing data. We test the framework with a forcing data set from a downscaled Global Circulation Model and assimilate four Earth Observation and two in situ data sets to initialize the forecasts. We investigate the hydrological response and seasonal predictions over a Swedish snowmelt‐dominated catchment using the HYPE model over 2001‐2015. The framework allows assessing the improvement in seasonal skill due to the different assimilated data and meteorological forcing. For the studied catchment, all Earth Observation and in situ data sets add information to the final forecast. The lead times during which data assimilation influences forecast skill also differ between data sets and seasons eg, assimilating snow water equivalent impacts the forecast for more than 20 weeks during winter. Lastly, assimilated data sets are generally more important to streamflow forecasting skill than meteorological forcing in the studied snow‐dominated catchment. This article is protected by copyright.

While the structure of BBL above bare sediment beds has been well studied, little is known about the complex near‐bed flow structure within aquatic vegetation. In this study, we used high‐resolution laboratory measurements and numerical Large Eddy Simulations to investigate the near‐bed mean and turbulent flow properties within staggered‐ordered emergent vegetation under a wide range of flow conditions and densities. There is strong spatial variability of key near‐bed flow characteristics on the scale of the vegetation elements. Measurement locations that provide single‐point flow characteristics closest to the spatially averaged values were identified. The spatially averaged BBL thickness is influenced strongly by vegetation density. This impact of vegetation density is engendered through its direct control of near‐bed turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), which in turn is negatively correlated with BBL thickness, both locally in a given flow and across the range of flow conditions studied here. A model based on the near‐bed TKE is developed to predict the BBL thickness and, ultimately, the bed shear stress. Model predictions were in close agreement with the experimental and numerical results. These findings provide new insights into the physical links between near‐bed flow variables and therefore contribute to the understanding of some of the complex biophysical processes present in vegetated flows.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The structure of the bottom boundary layer (BBL) in aquatic flows influences a range of biophysical processes, including sediment transport, hyporheic exchange, and biofilm formation.

Across a range of modeled scenarios of gate closure frequencies, durations and river streamflows, we evaluate the changes caused by gate closures, as well as the recovery time to normal conditions. Our results for the Hudson show long-duration gate closures (three or more days) with low streamflows temporarily lead to salt intrusion and stratification beyond recent historical extremes. Moreover, monthly frequency closures, which could occur as soon as 2070 under realistic scenarios of sea-level rise and barrier management, do not allow for recovery under low streamflow conditions and could lead to durable changes to estuary physical conditions. As a result, long duration closures and high-frequency closures both constitute a threat to municipal water supplies. This study demonstrates a framework for understanding the potential impacts of any proposed surge barrier system and can help improve our understanding of corresponding ecological impacts.&lt;/p>;</content:encoded><dc:creator> Ziyu Chen, Philip M.

Yet, exactly how soil and stream DOM fractions are altered as snowmelt timing changes is not well understood. We studied the optical character of DOM as it moved through a first‐order northern hardwood watershed through the snowmelt period. While stream dissolved organic carbon (DOC; mean = 4.6 mg C L−1) concentrations were not correlated with snowmelt flushing, stream DOM appeared humic‐like throughout the study period (humification index, HIX; mean = 10.9). Within the stream, we measured seasonal increases in an inverse index of DOM molecular weight and processing (spectral slope, S275–295; range = 0.0102–0.0214) and in an index of recently derived DOM (Biological Index, BIX; range = 0.2–1.1). We measured a decrease in an inverse index of DOM oxidation (ratio of Peak C to Peak A, or C/A; range = 0.59–2.01) through the snowmelt period. Stream BIX and C/A tracked those measured in the north aspect soils throughout the study. C/A was unique as it decreased from source to stream, likely reflecting the diagenesis of DOM through soils. These data suggest that changes in the timing of snowmelt and hydrologic connectedness within a watershed affect seasonal changes in stream DOM character. We suggest that watersheds with deep glacial till parent materials have stream connectivity limited by subsurface flow paths, with stream DOM character being determined largely by slow melt and a longer period of infiltration.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In many watersheds, runoff occurring with snowmelt brings the largest pulse of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from soils to streams.

Considerable attention has been paid to identifying the influence of biased P or PET inputs independently. However, few studies have explored the joint interaction of biases in P and PET inputs on hydrological simulation. Here, we investigate the mutual compensation of P and PET biases on the performance of two widely used conceptual hydrological models, the Xinanjiang (XAJ) model and the Probability Distributed Model (PDM). P and PET from HYREX (HYdrological Radar EXperiment) and CAMELS‐GB (Catchment Attributes and Meteorology for Large‐sample Studies in Great Britain) data sets are collected over five catchments with varying characteristics in Great Britain. Different biases are added to these original time series to generate 6560 biased input scenarios. The results suggest that there is a certain compensational relationship between the biases in P and PET inputs to reproduce desirable streamflow simulations. A new hydrological proxy named Compensational Interaction Angle (CIA) is identified and found to be stationary with various modeling periods, as well as stable with different hydrological models despite the model&#39;s equifinality. Further, the CIA highly relates to the long‐term climate aridity ratio. The catchments with greater aridity have larger CIAs. This study provides a new perspective to analyze the input errors in hydrological modeling. The results can help to better understand P and PET interactions in hydrological modeling, and guide the selection/evaluation/bias‐correction of P and PET data sets for hydrological applications.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The quality of precipitation (&lt;i>;P&lt;/i>;) and potential evapotranspiration (&lt;i>;PET&lt;/i>;) data greatly affects the hydrological modeling performance.

To minimize model‐bias, this partitioning must be performed so as to ensure distributional representativeness and mutual consistency. However, failure to account for data sampling variability (DSV) in the underlying Data Generating Process can weaken the model&#39;s generalization performance. While “K‐fold cross‐validation” can mitigate this problem, it is computationally inefficient since the calibration/evaluation operations must be repeated numerous times. This paper develops a general strategy for stochastic evolutionary parameter optimization (SEPO) that explicitly accounts for DSV when calibrating a model using any population‐based evolutionary optimization algorithm (EOA), such as Shuffled Complex Evolution (SCE). Inspired in part by the machine‐learning strategy of stochastic gradient descent (SGD), we use various representative random sub‐samples to drive the EOA toward the distribution of the model parameters. Unlike in SGD, derivative information is not required and hence SEPO can be applied to any hydrological model where such information is not readily available. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, we implement it within the well‐known SCE, to calibrate the GR4J conceptual rainfall‐runoff model to 163 hydro‐climatically diverse catchments. Using only a single optimization run, our Stochastic SCE method converges to population‐based estimates of model parameter distributions (and corresponding simulation uncertainties), without compromising model performance during either calibration or evaluation. Further, it effectively reduces the need to perform independent evaluation tests of model performance under conditions that are represented by the available data.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;It is typical to use a &lt;i>; &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;>;single&lt;/span>; &lt;/i>; portion of the available data to calibrate hydrological models, and the remainder for model evaluation.

However, the effects of extensive floodplain inundation on saline aquifers are rarely considered and have not been examined previously under controlled laboratory conditions. We conducted laboratory experiments within a two‐dimensional (cross‐section) sand tank (ie, representing a saline floodplain aquifer) and built both laboratory‐ and field‐scale numerical models to examine lens responses to flood events. Three sets of experiments were performed to explore different lateral extents of floodplain inundation. The temporal behavior of experimental lenses was quantified and compared to variable‐density numerical models that adopted calibrated laboratory parameters, showing good agreement. Results show that more extensive floodplain inundation leads to larger lenses (as expected). The sensitivity analysis was performed based on field‐scale numerical models, demonstrating that the floodplain inundation extent, hydraulic conductivity, and dispersivity are key factors controlling the post‐flood recession in lens extent and volume. In field‐scale simulations of floodplain inundation, the entire lens was significantly salinized during flood recession due to enhanced dispersion accompanying higher groundwater velocities, which may further split into several isolated freshwater bodies before eventually returning to steady‐state conditions. Importantly, field‐scale numerical results indicated that the salt load to the adjacent river increased immediately following the flood event, consistent with reporting of the River Murray (South Australia).

Abrupt avulsion events (occurring over days to weeks) are potentially catastrophic to society and thus receive more attention than slow avulsions, which develop over decades to centuries and can be challenging to identify. Here, we examine gradual channel changes of the Peace‐Athabasca River Delta (PAD), Canada using in situ measurements and 37 years of Landsat satellite imagery. A developing avulsion of the Athabasca River is apparent along the Embarras River–Mamawi Creek (EM) distributary. Its opening and gradual enlargement since 1982 are evident from multiple lines of observation: Between 1984 and 2021 the discharge ratio between the EM and the Athabasca River more than doubled, increasing from 9% to 21%. The EM has widened by +53% since 1984, whereas the Athabasca River channel width has remained stable. The downstream Mamawi Creek delta is growing at a discharge‐normalized rate roughly twice that of the Athabasca River delta in surface area. Longitudinal global navigation satellite systems field surveys of water surface elevation reveal the EM possesses a ∼2X slope advantage (8 × 10−5 vs. 4 × 10−5) over the Athabasca River, and unit stream power and bed shear stress suggest enhanced sediment transport and erosional capacity through the evolving flow path. Our findings: (a) indicate that a slow avulsion of the Athabasca River is underway with potentially long‐term implications for inundation patterns, ecosystems, and human use of the PAD; and (b) demonstrate an observational approach for identifying other slow avulsions at river bifurcations globally.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Avulsions change river courses and transport water and sediment to new channels impacting infrastructure, floodplain evolution, and ecosystems.

The daily Princeton Global Forcing data set (0.25° × 0.25°, 1948–2016) was used to validate PTa. The calibration‐free PTa improved the simulation of aerodynamic components and, consequently, the accuracy of ETo estimation. The gridded global monthly PTa data set is fully open‐source and can be incorporated into hydrologic and crop models. We also demonstrated that PTa under equilibrium or quasi‐equilibrium evaporation conditions (1.26 ± 0.04) was very close to the default value. The simplified PTa, with relative humidity as the only input, still performed better than the original method. Results indicated that the radiative component was the driving factor of the global ETo changes from 1948 to 2016.

The results show that (a) for different succession stages during natural restoration, the ET of secondary forest (680 ± 7 mm yr&lt;sup>;−1&lt;/sup>;) &amp;gt; shrub (564 ± 16 mm yr&lt;sup>;−1&lt;/sup>;) &amp;gt; grass (546 ± 12 mm yr&lt;sup>;−1&lt;/sup>;) &amp;gt; cropland (513 ± 8 mm yr&lt;sup>;−1&lt;/sup>;) (&lt;i>;P&lt;/i>; &amp;lt; 0.05); (b) ET of all ecosystems are far less than that of precipitation (1,059 ± 63 mm yr&lt;sup>;−1&lt;/sup>;) but closer to potential ET (849 ± 11 mm yr&lt;sup>;−1&lt;/sup>;), and soil moisture has been maintained at &amp;gt;0.20 cm&lt;sup>;3&lt;/sup>;cm&lt;sup>;−3&lt;/sup>; in the growing season; (c) solar radiation and vapor pressure deficit are the two predominant factors on the ET (&lt;i>;P&lt;/i>; &amp;lt; 0.01), while there is no significant relationship between ET and soil moisture (&lt;i>;P&lt;/i>; &amp;gt; 0.05). The results suggest that vegetation restoration returned from cropland in humid karst regions increased ET but may not induce water scarcity for vegetation sustainability, at least under normal climatic conditions.&lt;/p>;</content:encoded><dc:creator> Ruzhou Yi, Xianli Xu, Yaohua Zhang, Zongda Ye, Kelin Wang</dc:creator><category> Research Article</category><dc:title> Grain for Green Project May Not Threaten Ecosystem Sustainability by Degrading Water Availability in Humid Karst Landscapes</dc:title><dc:identifier> 10.1029/2022WR032415</dc:identifier><prism:publicationname> Water Resources Research</prism:publicationname><prism:doi> 10.1029/2022WR032415</prism:doi><prism:url> https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022WR032415?af=R</prism:url><prism:section> Research Article</prism:section><prism:volume> 59</prism:volume><prism:number> 3个</prism:number></item><item><link/>https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022WR033514?af=R<pubDate> Tue, 28 Feb 2023 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate><dc:date> 2023-02-28T12:00:00-08:00</dc:date><source url="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/19447973?af=R"/> Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents<prism:coverdate> Wed, 01 Mar 2023 00:00:00 -0800</prism:coverdate><prism:coverdisplaydate> Wed, 01 Mar 2023 00:00:00 -0800</prism:coverdisplaydate><guid ispermalink="false"> 10.1029/2022WR033514</guid><title> Toward Large‐Scale Soil Moisture Monitoring Using Rail‐Based Cosmic Ray Neutron Sensing</title><description> Water Resources Research, Volume 59, Issue 3, March 2023.</description><dc:description> Abstract Cosmic ray neutron sensing (CRNS) has become a promising method for soil water content (SWC) monitoring. Stationary CRNS offers hectare‐scale average SWC measurements at fixed locations maintenance‐free and continuous in time, while car‐borne CRNS roving can reveal spatial SWC patterns at medium scales, but only on certain survey days. The novel concept of a permanent mobile CRNS system on rails promises to combine the advantages of both methods, while its technical implementation, data processing and interpretation raised a new level of complexity. This study introduced a fully automatic CRNS rail‐borne system as the first of its kind, installed within the locomotive of a cargo train. Data recorded from September 2021 to July 2022 along an ∼9 km railway segment were analyzed, as repeatedly used by the train, supported by local SWC measurements (soil samples and dielectric methods), car‐borne and stationary CRNS. The results revealed consistent spatial SWC patterns and temporary variation along the track at a daily resolution. The observed variability was mostly related to surface features, seasonal dynamics and different responses of the railway segments to wetting and drying periods, while some variations were related to measurement uncertainties. The achieved medium scale of SWC mapping could support large scale hydrological modeling and detection of environmental risks, such as droughts and wildfires. Hence, rail‐borne CRNS has the chance to become a central tool of continuous SWC monitoring for larger scales (≤10‐km), with the additional benefit of providing root‐zone soil moisture, potentially even in sub‐daily resolution.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Cosmic ray neutron sensing (CRNS) has become a promising method for soil water content (SWC) monitoring.

In this study, we applied a dynamic wave and Hairsine‐Rose model simulator on hillslopes composed of various sizes of mounds and puddles. For the tested soil particles whose settling velocity is and rainfall intensity of , we found that soil erosion quantity is significantly affected by microtopographic roughness, even under the same rainfall‐runoff conditions. In addition, we found that soil particle size can potentially determine whether there is a direct or inverse proportionality relationship between microtopographic roughness and soil erosion rate on hillslopes. That is, when the land surface layer is composed of relatively small soil particles, rough microtopographies accelerate soil erosion rates compared to smooth microtopographies. In contrast, when it is composed of large soil particles, soil erosion increases more on smooth microtopographies than on rough microtopographies, at least under the tested conditions. Finally, it was revealed that the progress of the microtopographic scale armoring process is closely related to the microtopographic roughness as well as the grain size. Thus, to appropriately consider the role of microtopography in soil erosion problems, the processes of pickup, advection, and deposition related to armoring must be physically considered. Without sufficient information on these features, low prediction accuracy is expected, not only of the quantity but also in the quality of soil erosion.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The effects of microtopography on erosion remain uncertain, and contradictory findings have been reported in past decades, hindering full understanding and accurate prediction of the quantity and quality of soil erosion caused by rainfall-runoff.

Particles migrating from the vegetated region are entrained into the vegetation‐side bare channel region by turbulent structures.

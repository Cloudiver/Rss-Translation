Thus, understanding their interaction with and transport through materials is important. We examine the impact of nanoparticle hydrophobicity and porous medium surface area on the transport of carbon nanoparticles through sand‐packed columns under saturated and unsaturated conditions. The fluorescent carbon nanoparticles (FCNs) used in this study, synthesized from citric acid and ethanolamine, exhibit synthesis‐temperature‐dependent hydrophobicity. To quantify the impact of hydrophobicity on retention, we use FCNs synthesized at four temperatures: 190°C (FCN190), 210°C (FCN210), 230°C (FCN230), and 250°C (FCN250). Several observations are noted. First, the more hydrophobic particles (FCN230 and FCN250) attain lower outlet concentrations and mass recovery than more hydrophilic particles (FCN190 and FCN210). For instance, while 77% of the FCN190 was recovered after passing through a fine‐sand‐packed column, only 23% of the FCN250 was recovered. Second, sand surface area significantly impacts FCN recovery. A 17‐fold increase in sand surface area yields a 30% decrease in the recovery of FCN210. Third, no significant difference in the mass recovery of the FCNs was observed between the unsaturated and saturated conditions, which is attributed to the small size of the FCNs relative to the water film thickness surrounding sand grains. Fourth, the particle transport model in HYDRUS‐1D successfully simulated FCN transport, showing approximately a tenfold increase in the attachment coefficient for hydrophobic FCNs.

To address this gap, 18 groundwater samples were taken from the Qianjiadian sandstone U ore field, including seven samples from production wells in mining area M1 (mining for 5 years), six samples from production wells in mining area M2 (mining for 4 years), and five samples from monitoring wells (GC), to quantify U‐mobilizing processes in the mining aquifer by employing hydrogeochemical compositions and multi‐isotopes. The introduction of O2 and CO2 efficiently stimulated U mobilization in the mining aquifer. The injected CO2 critically promoted the dissolution of carbonate minerals, which enhanced the formation of uranyl carbonate (predominantly CaUO2(CO3)22− and Ca2UO2(CO3)3(aq)) and thus facilitated U mobility. Generally, δ34SSO4 and δ18OSO4 in M2 and M1 were significantly lower than those in GC (p &lt; 0.01). A Bayesian isotope mixing model of δ34SSO4 and δ18OSO4 showed that the contribution of pyrite oxidation to SO42− concentration increased from 1.7% in GC to 13.6% in M2 and to 15.0% in M1. During ISL, pyrite, ammonium, and dissolved organic carbon were major compounds competing with U(IV) for introduced O2 in the ore‐bearing aquifer. Most of the consumed O2 was used for pyrite oxidation (56.2%) and U(IV) oxidation (39.3%), following the thermodynamic sequence of those redox reactions. The current results highlighted the significance of increasing O2 utilization efficiency in improving the performance of ISL operations.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;img src=&quot;https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c9d3f16a-0061-47eb-ad3e-d9afd2c69989/wrcr26533-toc-0001-m.png&quot; alt=&quot;Multi-Isotope Based Identification and Quantification of Oxygen Consuming Processes in Uranium Hosting Aquifers With CO2 + O2 In Situ Leaching&quot;/>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>; &lt;br/>; &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Although neutral in situ leaching through CO&lt;sub>;2&lt;/sub>; + O&lt;sub>;2&lt;/sub>; is employed to extract uranium (U) in sandstone by in situ leaching (ISL), mechanisms of U mobilization and O&lt;sub>;2&lt;/sub>; consumption remained unclear.

The main controlling parameters of step formation and stability are hydraulic forcing, sediment transport, and granular effects (ie, grain‐grain interlocking, jamming). Previous studies found macrorough sidewalls to further increase bed stability due to grain‐sidewall interlocking but the effect of the reduced bed shear stress caused by sidewall friction was not explicitly considered. The present study aims at untangling hydraulic effects induced by the macrorough sidewalls and granular effects, ie, grain‐sidewall interaction. Flume experiments with five types of macrorough sidewalls were conducted under clear‐water conditions for bed slopes ranging between 4% and 10% and jamming ratios 5.3 &lt; Wm/d84 &lt; 11.2, where Wm is the mean channel width and d84 is a characteristic grain size of the sediment mixture. A modified sidewall correction procedure accounting for sidewall friction was applied to estimate bed shear stress. Bed stability considerably increased with increasing sidewall roughness. The dimensionless bed shear stress θRb controlled step occurrence as the system evolved towards a state of a maximum number of steps for critical Shields ratios θRb/θc ≈ 1. Contrary to the expectations, fewer steps formed in the roughest sidewall experiments as few very stable steps inhibited sediment relocation and therewith step formation. Steps were more frequently located in the constrictions caused by the macrorough elements and sustained higher bed shear stress increments. Overall, hydraulic effects fully explained the increase in bed stability in moderately rough sidewall experiments whereas granular effects became important in channels with strong local constrictions.

Here we show how estimation of rainfall frequency curves can be improved through fitting a four‐parameter Kappa distribution to a peaks‐over‐threshold (POT) series. To fit the Kappa distribution to POT data we present a two‐step fitting approach based on maximum likelihood estimation which separately models storm intensity and the arrival frequency. First, a Generalized Pareto distribution describing storm intensity is fitted, followed by a Binomial distribution for storm arrivals. We compare the performance of this two‐step Kappa approach to an analogous two‐step Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) approach, and to Kappa and GEV distributions fitted to annual maxima series (AMS), using both synthetic and real‐world data representative of Australian climatic conditions. The experiments show that leveraging additional information from the POT series in the two‐step Kappa approach dramatically improves quantile estimation and reduces uncertainty compared to fitting either the GEV or the Kappa distributions to AMS, particularly for rare quantiles. When skew‐kurtosis properties of extreme rainfalls are well represented by the Kappa but not the GEV, the two‐step Kappa approach yields unbiased quantiles under extrapolation, while use of GEV can lead to highly biased estimates. From these results we believe the two‐step Kappa approach is suitable for both at‐site and regional rainfall frequency analyses as it can accommodate distributions ranging from GPD to GEV without encountering over‐fitting problems generally associated with four‐parameter distributions.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Accurate estimation of annual exceedance probabilities (AEPs) of extreme rainfalls through rainfall frequency analysis is a critical step in engineering design for flood mitigation and disaster response.

The resultant plant motion impacts the vegetation wake structure and, thus, the rate of lateral dispersion in these environments. Despite significant improvements in our understanding of dispersion in rigid canopies, a reliable framework to predict mixing in oscillating canopies is still lacking. This research demonstrates how plant oscillation can profoundly impact rates of lateral mixing in steady flows. The lateral dispersion coefficients were evaluated experimentally, using photographs of injected dye plumes within two types of emergent flexible model vegetation. Results revealed a significant increase in the rates of lateral dispersion (by up to 45%) due to the plant oscillation. A predictive model, based on a redefined vegetation density that incorporates the impact of plant oscillation, was developed that can accurately predict dispersion in emergent canopies. A quantitative prediction of dispersion in oscillating flexible vegetation is a significant step towards a more accurate description of material transport in aquatic environments.

The resultant plant motion impacts the vegetation wake structure and, thus, the rate of lateral dispersion in these environments. Despite significant improvements in our understanding of dispersion in rigid canopies, a reliable framework to predict mixing in oscillating canopies is still lacking. This research demonstrates how plant oscillation can profoundly impact rates of lateral mixing in steady flows.

The approach accounts for the attenuation of pollutants transported along complex drain networks from fields to drain‐network outlets. The approach produces a Pareto‐optimal cost curve of irrigation‐system upgrade combinations that compromise between maximizing the reduction of drain‐outlet loads and minimizing upgrade implementation costs. The approach utilizes a graph‐theoretic data structure to organize drain‐network data, route drain‐network flow paths, and formulate objectives and constraints for multi‐objective optimization. Due to the linearity of the objective functions and constraints, Pareto‐optimal solutions are obtained along the cost curve by prioritizing fields by decreasing load‐reduction/cost ratio (pollutant load‐reduction per cost). Multi‐objective optimization will identify additional Pareto‐optimal solutions along the cost curve providing additional compromises. The approach allows for a computationally efficient prioritization, providing a level of complexity that is able to incorporate commonly available data. The cost curve is highly sensitive to the pollutant attenuation coefficient, with higher attenuation coefficients resulting in low sensitivity of load reduction to cost. While the focus of this work is on irrigation‐system upgrades, there are other conservation actions and/or land‐use change scenarios that this method could also prioritize. Analyses of this nature could prove valuable in improving the allocation of limited conservation funding and/or developing cost‐effective water quality trading programs. We demonstrate the approach on a collection of drain networks around Grand View, Idaho, USA with the objective to reduce total phosphorus loads to the Snake River.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;We develop and demonstrate an approach to optimally prioritize fields for irrigation-system upgrades to improve agricultural-drain discharge water quality.

The proposed procedure consists of two steps: in the first step the optimization of the location of devices is performed, then the optimal selection and regulation is investigated in the second step. Two new mixed integer non‐linear models have been developed and a global optimization solver has been employed to perform both optimization procedures. The procedure has been tested on a real irrigation network in Spain. The entire 2015 irrigation season has been used to properly model the water demand within the system. According to the results, the optimal solution consists of 5 PATs, installed in the middle region of the system. The investment cost has been estimated as 169,278 € with a payback period of almost 4.2 irrigation seasons. According to the solution, the effective amount of produced energy is equal to 289 MWh if the system is properly regulated and the pressure exceeding the minimum requirements is exploited to produce energy. Compared to other studies in literature focused on irrigated agriculture, the number of PATs is not fixed but rather it results from the maximization of the energy recovery and the minimization of capital costs, simultaneously. Moreover, the proposed procedure relies on a deterministic approach, achieving promising results in terms of accuracy.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In this study a new procedure to address the optimization of the location and selection of pumps as turbines (PATs) within irrigation networks is presented in order to reduce network pressure and recover energy.

Accurate knowledge of streamflow constituents is required for resilient water resources management; this is precluded by a paucity of measurement as well as climatological and topographic complexity. Here we integrate citizen scientist acquired geochemical samples, collected from October 2018 through September 2019 in the Shimshal watershed of the Karakoram Mountains of Pakistan, with Sentinel‐1 (S1) synthetic aperture radar (SAR)‐derived wet snow maps, to better understand streamflow constituents for the high altitude and heavily glaciated catchment. We use Bayesian end‐member mixture analysis to separate river flows into baseflow and meltwater constituents, using fixed and time‐variant melt end‐member values. We compare river hydrograph separation results with S1 wet snow time series maps for the same timeframe. We then utilize S1 imagery to inform end‐member mixture analysis to separate meltwaters into snow and glacier melt. For the Shimshal catchment, we find that about 85% of annual river flows are derived from snow and glacier melt; 45% of annual flows are derived from snow melt and 40% glacier melt. Engaged and committed citizen scientists enabled geochemical sample collection and analysis on a significant temporal and spatial scale. In the future, co‐produced knowledge that both implements local expertise and that is also planned and utilized by diverse stakeholders may increase climatological awareness and resilience in the UIB.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Upper Indus Basin (UIB) streamflow originates largely from glacier and snow melt in the upstream Himalaya, Karakoram, and Hindu Kush mountain ranges and is extremely vulnerable because of its projected climate changes, dense populations, and hydropolitical tensions.

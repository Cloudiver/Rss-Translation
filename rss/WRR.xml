The general inverse modeling method needs to iteratively adjust the uncertain parameters, which is a difficult and time-consuming high-dimensional sampling problem. To address this problem, we propose a deep-learning-based inverse modeling method called pix2pixGAN-DSI. In this method, the deep-learning-based image-to-image generative adversarial network (pix2pixGAN) is constructed to directly predict the posterior parameter fields from the posterior dynamic responses obtained by the data-space inversion (DSI) method. This inverse modeling method does not need to iteratively adjust the uncertain parameters, which improves computational efficiency. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through a Gaussian model case and two non-Gaussian channelized model cases.

In the Water Resources category of the Web of Science, a thorough investigation of the reliability of this metric is lacking. This study analyzed the citation records of the top 10 journals from 2002 through 2021 for the last two decades. Important to note, there are inconsistencies in the Web of Science database. Contradictory to many fields, few papers are uncited. However, the Simpson paradox applies. More specifically, on the one hand, the correlation between citations to papers 7 years post publication and 1 or 2 years post publication (which determine the IF) has increased, which supports this metric. On the other hand, many of the most highly cited papers at the time of the IF calculation are lowly cited 5 years afterward. Additionally, most currently very highly cited papers were relatively uncited when they were used in the IF calculation. This raises doubt about the usefulness of this metric. For a limited number of journals, papers from individual nations strongly influence the IF. Also, for a few journals, the IFs are strongly influenced by review papers, but leaving these out of the IF does change the top 3 and 10 of the rankings. The general conclusion is that IFs do contain some valuable information about the journals&#39; citation impact, but that using them to rank journals is questionable practice.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Despite regularly being criticized, the Impact Factor (IF) remains a widely used journal analysis metric.

However, most existing budget closure correction methods (BCCs) are significantly affected by errors in the budget‐component products. Moreover, these existing BCCs do not fully account for the preselection of high‐precision input data sets before enforcing the water budget closure, resulting in uncertainties in the budget‐corrected data sets. In this study, a two‐step method was proposed to enforce the water budget closure of satellite‐based hydrological products. First, high‐precision budget‐component data sets were selected and second, the water budget closure of the selected high‐precision data sets was then enforced by proposing an improved BCC strategy, that is, the Minimized Series Deviation method (MSD). The performance of the proposed two‐step method was verified in 24 global basins by comparing it to three existing BCCs of varying complexity, that is, Proportional Redistribution (PR), Constrained Kalman Filter (CKF), and Multiple Collocation (MCL). The results showed that compared to the existing BCCs, the proposed two‐step method significantly improved the accuracy of budget‐corrected data sets in the range of 2%–19% (statistical analysis was based root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) with estimated observation (EO) as a reference). This study also summarized the main factors influencing the performance of the existing BCCs and their further development prospects based on the results.

To appreciate the complex spatial and temporal interactions of carbon cycling in flowing waters, ecosystem metabolism (gross primary production [GPP] and ecosystem respiration [ER]) must be resolved at the scale of an entire river network. Here, we propose a meta‐ecosystem framework that couples light and temperature regimes with a reach‐scale ecosystem model and integrates network structure, catchment land cover, and the hydrologic regime. The model simulates the distributed functioning of dissolved and particulate organic carbon, autotrophic biomass, and thus ecosystem metabolism, and reproduces fairly well the metabolic regimes observed in 12 reaches of the Ybbs River network, Austria. Results show that the annual network–scale metabolism was heterotrophic, yet with a clear peak of autotrophy in spring. Autochthonous energy sources contributed 43% of the total ER. We further investigated the effect of altered thermal and hydrologic regimes on metabolism and ecosystem efficiency. We predicted that an increase of 2.5°C in average stream water temperature could boost ER and GPP by 31% (24%–57%) and 28% (5%–57%), respectively. The effect of flashier hydrologic regimes is more complex and depends on autotrophic biomass density.

Radon (222Rn) has been widely used as a natural geochemical tracer to quantify SGD, but field measurements are time consuming and costly. Here, we use deep learning to predict coastal seawater radon in SGD‐impacted regions. We hypothesize that deep learning could resolve radon trends and enable preliminary insights with limited field observations of groundwater tracers. Two deep learning models were trained on global coastal seawater radon observations (n = 39,238) with widely available inputs (eg, salinity, temperature, water depth). The first model used a one‐dimensional convolutional neural network (1D‐CNN‐RNN) framework for site‐specific gap filling and producing short‐term future predictions. A second model applied a fully connected neural network (FCNN) framework to predict radon across geographically and hydrologically diverse settings. Both models can predict observed radon concentrations with r2 >; 0.76. Specifically, the FCNN model offers a compelling development because synthetic radon tracer datasets can be obtained using only basic water quality and meteorological parameters. This opens opportunities to attain radon data from regions with large data gaps, such as the Global South and other remote locations, allowing for insights that can be used to predict SGD and plan field experiments. Overall, we demonstrate how field‐based measurements combined with big‐data approaches such as deep learning can be utilized to assess radon and potentially SGD beyond local scales.本文受版权保护。版权所有。</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) is an important driver of coastal biogeochemical budgets worldwide.

The first model used a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN-RNN) framework for site-specific gap filling and producing short-term future predictions. A second model applied a fully connected neural network (FCNN) framework to predict radon across geographically and hydrologically diverse settings. Both models can predict observed radon concentrations with r&lt;sup>;2&lt;/sup>; &amp;gt; 0.76. Specifically, the FCNN model offers a compelling development because synthetic radon tracer datasets can be obtained using only basic water quality and meteorological parameters. This opens opportunities to attain radon data from regions with large data gaps, such as the Global South and other remote locations, allowing for insights that can be used to predict SGD and plan field experiments. Overall, we demonstrate how field-based measurements combined with big-data approaches such as deep learning can be utilized to assess radon and potentially SGD beyond local scales.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This article is protected by copyright.

The proposed procedure consists of two steps: in the first step the optimization of the location of devices is performed, then the optimal selection and regulation is investigated in the second step. Two new mixed integer non‐linear models have been developed and a global optimization solver has been employed to perform both optimization procedures. The procedure has been tested on a real irrigation network in Spain. The entire 2015 irrigation season has been used to properly model the water demand within the system. According to the results, the optimal solution consists of 5 PATs, installed in the middle region of the system. The investment cost has been estimated as 169,278 € with a payback period of almost 4.2 irrigation seasons. According to the solution, the effective amount of produced energy is equal to 289 MWh if the system is properly regulated and the pressure exceeding the minimum requirements is exploited to produce energy. Compared to other studies in literature focused on irrigated agriculture, the number of PATs is not fixed but rather it results from the maximization of the energy recovery and the minimization of capital costs, simultaneously. Moreover, the proposed procedure relies on a deterministic approach, achieving promising results in terms of accuracy.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In this study a new procedure to address the optimization of the location and selection of pumps as turbines (PATs) within irrigation networks is presented in order to reduce network pressure and recover energy.

We present two alternatives to the two‐source evapotranspiration (ET) model, which utilize a more accurate approximation of the Clausius‐Clapeyron relation. Model performance was evaluated through a comparison with observed half‐hourly eddy covariance fluxes. Modeled representations of sensible heat dynamics and the limiting behaviors were also evaluated to identify the causes of model inaccuracies. Our analysis shows that the new exponential approximation used here significantly reduces errors that stem from solutions to the energy balance equations. The proposed parallel and series models are both more accurate than the Shuttleworth‐Wallace (SW) model under the conditions evaluated here, but we cannot conclude that the new models are consistently more accurate over a broader range of conditions. The new models can correctly reproduce several theoretical limiting behaviors, whereas the SW model generates conceptually incorrect results for several important limiting cases in which some key conductances approach both zero and infinity. Importantly, these models seriously underestimate the observed latent heat fluxes at night; the major causes of the nighttime model inadequacies are thought to be uncertainties of the estimated conductances and forcing data errors. The central concepts and processes related to new models are described via plots of temperature versus specific humidity to explore the theory behind an ET model. Through these efforts, we anticipate making more reliable ET predictions that will lead to a complete understanding of vegetation–atmosphere interactions.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Environmental models are sensitive to inaccuracies in their approximation algorithms, which can bias model simulations and even lead to incorrect concepts.

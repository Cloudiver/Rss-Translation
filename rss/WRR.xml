This study demonstrates that EIE via rotating dipoles diminishes the remediation outcome uncertainty induced by medium heterogeneity.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In the context of in situ groundwater remediation, mixing is vital for a successful outcome. A slow mixing rate between the contaminated groundwater and the injected treatment solution can severely weaken the effective degradation rate. Engineered Injection-Extraction (EIE) has been proposed as a means to accelerate dilution within the porous medium. However, existing studies on the subject have not considered the potential impact of connectivity and preferential flow-paths. Neglecting connectivity can lead to an overestimation of EIE&#39;s capabilities, since the fluid may in reality be carried mainly through a few high-permeability channels, thus hampering mixing and reaction. Due to the fact that channeling can be found in many actual sites, in this work we aim to evaluate EIE methods in both poorly connected (represented as Multigaussian fields) and well-connected fields (represented as non-Multigaussians). The approach is to identify, for each given medium, a stirring protocol—defined by a specific combination of rotation angle and rotation rate—which maximizes mixing. To that end, metrics are proposed in order to (a) quantify both the mixing and the containment of the treatment solution within a given remediation volume, and (b) characterize the particle trajectories to explicitly evaluate if preferential paths are broken. The results obtained from these metrics are quite similar for both types of fields, proving that the enhancing of mixing by means of EIE is effective regardless of the presence of preferential flow paths. This study demonstrates that EIE via rotating dipoles diminishes the remediation outcome uncertainty induced by medium heterogeneity.&lt;/p>;</content:encoded><dc:creator> O. Bertran, D.

However, a BME‐based analysis has two main limitations: (a) it does not account for a model&#39;s posterior predictive performance after using the data for calibration and (b) it leads to biased results when comparing models that use different subsets of the observations for calibration. To address these limitations, we propose augmenting BMS and BMJ analyses with additional information‐theoretic measures: expected log‐predictive density (ELPD), relative entropy (RE) and information entropy (IE). Exploring the connection between Bayesian inference and information theory, we explicitly link BME and ELPD together with RE and IE to highlight the information flow in BMS and BMJ analyses. We show how to compute and interpret these scores alongside BME, and apply the framework to a controlled 2D groundwater setup featuring five models, one of which uses a subset of the data for calibration.

Chemical analysis (diagnostic tools of mixing models, end member mixing analysis, tritium, etc.) and physical data (stream stage, piezometers, soil water, snowpack, etc.) indicate there are two primary pathways of water input into a headwater stream sourced from a mountain meadow. One input is a shallower and younger subsurface pathway with water that resembles snowpack chemistry, and the other a deeper and older subsurface pathway with water that reflects the chemistry of the groundwater derived from the contributing hillslopes. Multi‐year observations reveal that regardless of snowpack amount, during the period of peak hillslope infiltration, shallow and deep pathways in the hillslope behave similarly to initiate headwater streams. However, during summer dry periods, similarities in active pathways within the meadow center are not maintained between high and low snowpack years. With less snow, perennial groundwater discharge within the meadow center is eliminated, becoming only a seasonal source at the meadow&#39;s outlet. At the meadow&#39;s edge, geophysically observed downslope thinning in saprolite thickness creates reduced lateral transmissivity and initiation points for headwater streams via enhanced groundwater discharge of upslope water. Combined, these findings suggest how loss of snowpack and critical zone structure can together mediate hydrologic function in a wet meadow system in a Mediterranean climate.

Remote sensing approaches capture large‐scale moisture patterns but are limited in spatial and temporal resolution, while commercial field sensors remain too expensive to deploy intensively over large spatial extents. Here, we demonstrate the use of low‐cost (&lt;20 USD) custom sensors to create a large monitoring network of surficial (0‐15 cm depth) volumetric soil moisture content (VMC) across Great Smoky Mountains National Park (NC, TN, USA). In laboratory tests, temperature‐calibrated VMC values approached the accuracy of commercial probes. We deployed over 80 sensors across multiple watersheds, topographic positions, and a 1800‐m elevation gradient, and created hierarchical models to understand associations of VMC with spatial (30‐m resolution) and temporal (daily) variables related to water supply and demand. Elevation had the strongest association with VMC, with a 5‐fold increase across the gradient reflecting 1.5‐fold changes in both (increased) precipitation and (decreased) evapotranspiration; slope angle was a strong mediating factor. Common proxies for moisture including topographic convergence index (TCI) were not associated with VMC, likely due to limited contributions of surface drainage to local water balance. Our model predicted daily VMC of a set of validation sensors with a root mean square error of 4.8%, which may be improved by site‐specific field calibration. Our study indicates that spatially extensive, field‐based soil moisture networks are practical, accurate, and an important component of regional environmental monitoring.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Understanding the distribution of soil moisture is notoriously difficult in topographically complex regions that are subject to both large-scale climate gradients and fine-scale effects of terrain, vegetation, and soil structure.

Therefore, it is one of the main reasons for uncertainty in the design of this infrastructure. The increasing number of water demand data sets offers opportunities to improve the traditional deterministic design approaches of WDNs by combining statistical and optimization methods. Robust optimization (RO) takes demand uncertainty into account by studying solutions that perform well under any possible demand scenario, that is, any possible realizations of this variable in the lifetime of a WDN. The right choice of scenario is therefore essential to ensure the reliability of the designed network. This paper presents a statistical methodology for generating scenarios to be used to solve a robust design optimization problem. It involves three steps: (a) descriptive analytics of historical data to derive the marginal distributions of peak hour demand in each node of the WDN, (b) generation of a very large number of snapshots by stratified sampling from the correlated marginal distributions of nodal peak demand, (c) generation of the peak demand scenarios by reducing the number of snapshots. Two heuristic techniques are proposed to reduce the number of snapshots, and for each of them, two different numbers of scenarios are derived.

This spatial variability has a profound, yet still partially understood, impact on conservative transport. Moreover, molecular diffusion is often a disregarded process that can have an important counter‐intuitive effect on transport: diffusion can prevent non‐Fickian tailing by mobilizing mass otherwise trapped in low velocity zones. Here, we focus on macroscopically homogeneous soils presenting small scale heterogeneity, as described by the Miller‐Miller theory. We then analyze the dynamic control of soil heterogeneity, advection and diffusion on conservative transport. We focus especially on the importance of diffusion and of its tortuosity‐dependent spatial variability on the overall transport. Our results confirm previous finding that relatively high Péclet number systems are highly sensitive to the degree of heterogeneity, which promotes non‐Fickian transport. Also, diffusion appears to have a profound impact on transport, depending on both the degree of heterogeneity and the Péclet number. For a high Péclet number and a very heterogeneous system, diffusion leads to the counter‐intuitive decrease of non‐Fickian spreading described previously. This is not observed for a low Péclet number due to the impact of the spatial variability in the diffusion coefficient, which appears to be a significant controlling factor of transport by promoting or preventing the accumulation of mass in low velocity zones. Globally, this work (1) highlights the complex, synergistic effect of soil heterogeneity, advective fluxes and diffusion on transport and (2), alerts on potential upscaling challenges when the spatial variability of such key processes cannot be properly described.

This is not observed for a low Péclet number due to the impact of the spatial variability in the diffusion coefficient, which appears to be a significant controlling factor of transport by promoting or preventing the accumulation of mass in low velocity zones. Globally, this work (1) highlights the complex, synergistic effect of soil heterogeneity, advective fluxes and diffusion on transport and (2), alerts on potential upscaling challenges when the spatial variability of such key processes cannot be properly described.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This article is protected by copyright.

The Gulf of Alaska (GoA) region is an embodiment of this change, particularly concerning a shifting hydrologic balance. Even so, the magnitude and contribution of fresh submarine groundwater discharge (fresh SGD) remains virtually unexplored within the region, though it has gained increasing attention globally due to its chemical significance and influence on coastal ecosystems. Here we provide the first regional estimates of fresh SGD to the GoA using two established water balance approaches. This is an effective way to distinguish the contribution of terrestrially derived fresh SGD, rather than the more commonly quantified total SGD which includes discharge that is driven by marine forces such as sea‐level oscillations and density gradients. We compare the approaches and assess their capabilities in computing the magnitude of fresh SGD over a large regional scale. Mean annual fresh SGD flux ranges between 26.5 and 86.8 km3 yr−1 to the GoA, equivalent to 3.5%–11.4% of the total freshwater discharge. Contributions are highest in the Southeastern panhandle and lowest in the Cook Inlet basin, with the highest area normalized contribution occurring in the Prince William Sound. Fresh SGD exhibits high spatial and temporal variability throughout the region. Although freshwater discharge to the GoA is investigated considerably, the importance of fresh SGD has, thus far, been overlooked.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;High latitude mountain environments are experiencing disproportionately adverse effects from climate change.

Finally, it was revealed that the progress of the microtopographic scale armoring process is closely related to the microtopographic roughness as well as the grain size. Thus, to appropriately consider the role of microtopography in soil erosion problems, the processes of pickup, advection, and deposition related to armoring must be physically considered. Without sufficient information on these features, low prediction accuracy is expected, not only of the quantity but also in the quality of soil erosion.&lt;/p>;</content:encoded><dc:creator> Soyoung Kim, Minyeob Jeong, Jongho Kim, Dae‐Hong Kim</dc:creator><category> Research Article</category><dc:title> Effects of Soil Particle Size on Relationship Between Mound‐Puddle Type Microtopography Roughness and Soil Erosion Rate on a Hillslope Basin: Hairsine–Rose Model Analysis</dc:title><dc:identifier> 10.1029/2022WR033879</dc:identifier><prism:publicationname> Water Resources Research</prism:publicationname><prism:doi> 10.1029/2022WR033879</prism:doi><prism:url> https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022WR033879?af=R</prism:url><prism:section> Research Article</prism:section><prism:volume> 59</prism:volume><prism:number> 3个</prism:number></item><item><link/>https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022WR033374?af=R<pubDate> Mon, 27 Feb 2023 17:19:36 -0800</pubDate><dc:date> 2023-02-27T05:19:36-08:00</dc:date><source url="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/19447973?af=R"/> Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents <prism:coverdate></prism:coverdate><prism:coverdisplaydate></prism:coverdisplaydate><guid ispermalink="false"> 10.1029/2022WR033374</guid><title> Out of sight out of mind: Household perceptions of “fair” water prices in Nairobi, Kenya.</title><description> Water Resources Research, Accepted Article.</description><dc:description> Abstract Providing piped water and sewer services is extremely capital intensive, yet most of this infrastructure is buried, hidden from citizens and ratepayers.

In this study, we examined the effect of macropores on saline water evaporation and pore‐water salinity based on laboratory experiments and numerical simulations. Soil columns with and without an artificial macropore were packed with clay‐loam and were set with different hydraulic heads fixed at the bottom. The results showed that increase in pore‐water salinity significantly reduced evaporation rates. The preferential flow induced by macropores recharged the soil surrounding macropores and maintained higher evaporation rates in comparison with homogeneous soil without macropores. As macropores induced lateral flow, the pore‐water salinity in shallow soil around the macropores was reduced but that in the area away from the macropores was increased. These impacts were more remarkable on the soil layers with higher hydraulic heads. A sensitivity analysis showed that with a higher initial pore‐water salinity, the macropore&#39;s impact on soil evaporation rates was more remarkable for both clay‐loam and silt‐loam. These results revealed the effect of macropores on soil evaporation processes and soil conditions, and also shed light on associated biogeochemical processes in salt marshes.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Macropores such as crab burrows are a common feature of salt marsh sediment and are recognized as an important factor influencing pore-water flow in salt marshes.

As a key variable in the CR, Epo estimates by conventional models have a long‐standing problem in practical applications. That is, the meteorological forcings (ie, radiation and temperature) employed in conventional Epo models are observed under actual conditions that are generally not saturated. Hence, conventional Epo models do not conform to the original definition of Epo (ie, the evaporation that would occur with an unlimited water supply). Here, we estimate Epo using the maximum evaporation approach (Epo_max) that does follow the original Epo definition. We find that adopting Epo_max considerably reduces the asymmetry of the CR compared to when the conventional Priestley‐Taylor Epo is used. We then employ Epo_max and develop a new physically based, calibration‐free CR model, which shows an overall good performance in estimating actual evaporation in 705 catchments at the mean annual scale and 64 flux sites at monthly and mean annual scales (R2 ranges from 0.73 to 0.75 and root‐mean‐squared error ranges from 9.8 to 18.8 W m−2).Both the 705 catchments and 64 flux sites cover a wide range of climates. More importantly, the use of Epo_max leads to a new physical interpretation of the CR.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The complementary relationship (CR) provides a framework for estimating land surface evaporation with basic meteorological observations by acknowledging the relationship between actual evaporation, apparent potential evaporation and potential evaporation (&lt;i>;E&lt;/i>; &lt;sub>;po&lt;/sub>;).

Moreover, these existing BCCs do not fully account for the preselection of high‐precision input datasets before enforcing the water budget closure, resulting in uncertainties in the budget‐corrected datasets. In this study, a two‐step method was proposed to enforce the water budget closure of satellite‐based hydrological products. First, high‐precision budget‐component datasets were selected and second, the water budget closure of the selected high‐precision datasets was then enforced by proposing an improved BCC strategy, ie, the Minimized Series Deviation method (MSD). The performance of the proposed two‐step method was verified in 24 global basins by comparing it to three existing BCCs of varying complexity, ie, Proportional Redistribution (PR), Constrained Kalman Filter (CKF), and Multiple Collocation (MCL). The results showed that compared to the existing BCCs, the proposed two‐step method significantly improved the accuracy of budget‐corrected datasets in the range of 2‐19% (statistical analysis was based root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) with estimated observation (EO) as a reference). This study also summarized the main factors influencing the performance of the existing BCCs and their further development prospects based on the results.

Understanding changes in the composition of, and resource use by, soil microbial communities requires Eh predictability under shifting hydrologic drivers. Here, 50‐cm soil column installations are manipulated to vary hydrologic and geochemical conditions, and are extensively monitored by a dense instrumental deployment to record the depth‐time variation of physical and biogeochemical conditions. We contrast measurements of Eh, soil saturation and key compounds in water samples (probing the majority of soil microbial metabolisms) with computations of the relevant state variables, to investigate the interplay between soil moisture and redox potential dynamics. Our results highlight the importance of joint spatially resolved hydrologic flow/transport and redox processes, the worth of contrasting experiments and computations for a sufficient understanding of the Eh dynamics, and the minimum amount of biogeochemistry needed to characterize the dynamics of electron donors/acceptors that are responsible for the patterns of Eh not directly explained by physical oxic/anoxic transitions. As an example, measured concentrations of sulfate, ammonium and iron II suggest coexistence of both oxic and anoxic conditions. We find that the local saturation velocity (a threshold value of the time derivative of soil saturation) exerts a significant hysteretic control on oxygen intrusion and on the cycling of redox potentials, in contrast with approaches using a single threshold saturation level as the determinant of anoxic conditions.

We studied the optical character of DOM as it moved through a first‐order northern hardwood watershed through the snowmelt period. While stream dissolved organic carbon (DOC; mean = 4.6 mg CL‐1) concentrations were not correlated with snowmelt flushing, stream DOM appeared humic‐like throughout the study period (humification index, HIX; mean = 10.9). Within the stream, we measured seasonal increases in an inverse index of DOM molecular weight and processing (spectral slope, S275‐295; range = 0.0102 to 0.0214) and in an index of recently‐derived DOM (Biological Index, BIX; range = 0.2 to 1.1). We measured a decrease in an inverse index of DOM oxidation (ratio of Peak C to Peak A, or C/A; range = 0.59 to 2.01) through the snowmelt period. Stream BIX and C/A tracked those measured in the north aspect soils throughout the study. C/A was unique as it decreased from source to stream, likely reflecting the diagenesis of DOM through soils. These data suggest that changes in the timing of snowmelt and hydrologic connectedness within a watershed affect seasonal changes in stream DOM character.

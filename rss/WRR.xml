Monitoring the total load is difficult, especially because of the cost of the bed load transport measurement. This study proposes estimation models for the suspended-to-total load fraction using dimensionless hydro-morphological variables. Two prominent variable combinations were identified using the recursive feature elimination for support vector regression (SVR): (1) width-to-depth ratio, dimensionless particle size, flow Reynolds number, densimetric Froude number, and falling particle Reynolds number, and (2) flow Reynolds number, Froude number, and densimetric Froude number. The explicit relations between the suspended-to-total load fraction and the two combinations were revealed by two modern symbolic regression methods: multi-gene genetic programming and Operon.

Understanding the decision space around discharge is necessary for evaluating tradeoffs between environmental and other objectives. As a result of climate change, warming water temperatures are increasingly becoming a concern for thermally‐sensitive fauna. In California&#39;s largest river, the Sacramento, extinction risk of salmon populations is linked to high water temperatures. Yet, little is known about how much water temperature in lower reaches can be affected by reservoir discharge operations, and the potential benefits to salmon. We used a process‐based water temperature model to estimate the ability of reservoir discharge to mediate river temperature heating processes impacting downstream locations (discharge‐mediated temperature management). To bound this analysis, we used historical forcings over a recent 29‐year span. Results indicate reservoir discharge increases of up to 340 cms over the historical record could have decreased water temperature in the lower reaches by up to 3.6°C. Salmon require water below 20°C during most stages of their lifecycle, and we found that normative water operations could ensure 20°C was rarely exceeded for two potential management seasons, in late‐spring and early‐fall. These periods coincide with important rearing and migratory periods for salmon, during which they frequently experience excessive temperatures under the management status‐quo.

However, most analytical solutions previously developed to estimate pumping‐induced seawater intrusion considered a horizontal aquifer bed. In this study, we first developed a steady‐state analytical solution to quantify the maximum safe pumping rate in sloping unconfined coastal aquifers with a fixed‐flux inland boundary condition, using the single potential approach. The analytical solution corrected by an empirical factor is validated against the numerical simulation, which reproduces the corresponding numerical results well. It is found that coastal aquifers with a higher aquifer bed toward inland (ie, a positive sloping angle) yield a higher maximum safe pumping rate than that of coastal aquifers with a horizontal aquifer base, since the elevated freshwater head prevents seawater intrusion and enhances groundwater pumping. Specifically, for the aquifer bases with the sloping angle of 0.01 and −0.01, the maximum safe pumping rate is increased by 42.6% and decreased by 48.4%, respectively, in comparison to the case of a horizontal aquifer base, suggesting that neglecting the aquifer base slop can result in a significant error in estimating the maximum safe pumping rate. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis reveals that the maximum safe pumping rate increases with a lower hydraulic conductivity and a larger dispersivity. Our results provide valuable insights into the effect of the aquifer base slope on the maximum safe pumping in coastal aquifers, and analytical solutions developed can serve as a powerful tool for quick assessment of pumping‐induced seawater intrusion in sloping unconfined coastal aquifers.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Unconfined coastal aquifers with a sloping aquifer bed are ubiquitous.

To this end, we study the stochastic dynamics of the motion of advective particles that move along the streamlines of the heterogeneous flow field. While longitudinal dispersion may evolve super‐linearly with time, transverse dispersion is characterized by ultraslow diffusion, that is, the transverse displacement variance grows asymptotically with the logarithm of time. This remarkable behavior is linked to the solenoidal character of the flow field, which needs to be accounted for in stochastic models for the two‐dimensional particle motion. Here, we derive an upscaled model based on the statistical characterization of the motion of solute particles. To this end, we analyze particle velocities and orientations through equidistant sampling along the particle trajectories obtained from direct numerical simulations. This sampling strategy respects the flow structure, which is organized on a characteristic length scale. Perturbation theory shows that the longitudinal particle motion is determined by the variability of travel times, while the transverse motion is governed by the fluctuations of the space increments. The latter turns out to be strongly anticorrelated with a correlation structure that leads to ultraslow diffusion. Based on this analysis, we derive a stochastic model that combines a correlated Gaussian noise for the transverse motion with a spatial Markov model for the particle speeds.

The impact of mineral dissolution on flow characteristics depends on the connectivity and tortuosity of the pore network. Persistent homology is a tool from algebraic topology that describes the size and connectivity of topological features. When applied to 3D X‐ray computed tomography (XCT) imagery of rock cores, it provides a novel metric of pore network heterogeneity. Prior works have demonstrated the efficacy of persistent homology in predicting flow properties in numerical simulations of flow through porous media.

In this study, three limestone cores were imaged by XCT before and after acid‐driven dissolution flow‐through experiments. Each XCT scan was analyzed using persistent homology. In all three rocks, permeability increase was driven by the growth of large, connected pore bodies. The two most homogenous samples saw an increased effect nearer to the flow inlet, suggesting emerging preferential flow paths as the reaction front progresses. The most heterogeneous sample showed an increase in along‐core homogeneity during reaction. Variability of persistence showed moderate positive correlation with pore body size increase.

The ESI is computed using sediment fingerprinting information, sediment yield, and the areal coverage of the sediment sources (land use). We have used X‐ray diffraction (XRD) and Partial least square regression (PLSR) based spectral fingerprinting technique to apportion the land use classes as sources of sediments in a representative catchment of Chotanagpur Plateau (CP), India (Konar reservoir catchment). PLSR model on the XRD spectra has performed well with R2 >; 0.88 and identified agricultural areas as the major contributor of suspended sediments by delivering 28% to 43%, varying seasonally (in the period of 2018‐2019). However, based on the ESI values barren lands and human settlements were found to be the most crucial land use classes (with highest ESI value of 1.31 and 1.08 respectively) in terms of sediment generation (22% to 29% and 14% to 23% respectively) with only 14% and 12% areal coverage.

We have used X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Partial least square regression (PLSR) based spectral fingerprinting technique to apportion the land use classes as sources of sediments in a representative catchment of Chotanagpur Plateau (CP), India (Konar reservoir catchment). PLSR model on the XRD spectra has performed well with R&lt;sup>;2&lt;/sup>; &amp;gt; 0.88 and identified agricultural areas as the major contributor of suspended sediments by delivering 28% to 43%, varying seasonally (in the period of 2018-2019). However, based on the ESI values barren lands and human settlements were found to be the most crucial land use classes (with highest ESI value of 1.31 and 1.08 respectively) in terms of sediment generation (22% to 29% and 14% to 23% respectively) with only 14% and 12% areal coverage. The results have demonstrated that the state of critical conservation urgency of different land uses can be quantified more effectively when combining spectral tracers based knowledge with ESI.&lt;/p>;</content:encoded><dc:creator> Arnab Das, Renji Remesan, Ashok Kumar Gupta</dc:creator><category> Research Article</category><dc:title> Exploring suspended sediment dynamics using a novel indexing framework based on X‐ray diffraction spectral fingerprinting</dc:title><dc:identifier> 10.1029/2023WR034500</dc:identifier><prism:publicationname> Water Resources Research</prism:publicationname><prism:doi> 10.1029/2023WR034500</prism:doi><prism:url> https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR034500?af=R</prism:url><prism:section> Research Article</prism:section></item><item><link/> https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR034639?af=R<pubDate> Mon, 25 Sep 2023 05:44:16 -0700</pubDate><dc:date> 2023-09-25T05:44:16-07:00</dc:date><source url="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/19447973?af=R"/> Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents <prism:coverdate></prism:coverdate><prism:coverdisplaydate></prism:coverdisplaydate><guid ispermalink="false"> 10.1029/2023WR034639</guid><title> Influence of liquid splitting behavior at intersections on infiltration dynamics in an unsaturated fracture network</title><description> Water Resources Research, Accepted Article.</description><dc:description> Abstract Understanding the macro‐scale flow characteristics in the fractured vadose zone is of great importance for subsurface hydrological and environmental applications.

Clogging of sandy streambeds has previously been studied under losing and gaining flows and during streambed movement, but not when these two flow conditions coincided. We conducted flume experiments to quantify the combined effect of moving bedforms and losing or gaining flows on kaolinite deposition and streambed clogging. The experiments were conducted by adding pulses of kaolinite in a flume packed with sand under a stream water velocity of 25 cm/s. We measured the deposition rates, dynamics of hyporheic exchange flux (HEF) and vertical hydraulic conductivity (Kv), and the vertical distribution of kaolinite at the end of the experiments under two losing and two gaining flows (Darcy velocity of 10 and 20 cm/day). Kaolinite deposition led to clogging and reduction in Kv and HEF under all flow conditions. Deposition occurred faster under losing flow conditions than under gaining flow conditions. However, the changes in Kv and HEF were similar under losing and gaining flow conditions for similar kaolinite concentrations in the bed. Our results indicate that the deposition patterns of kaolinite were more influenced by bedform movement than by losing or gaining flow conditions, which is markedly different from the behavior observed under losing and gaining conditions for stationary bedforms. This implies that bedform morphodynamics control local‐scale clogging of sandy streambeds and should be accounted for when studying the hydrology of catchments at larger scales.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Clogging of streambeds due to clay deposition influences the stream-subsurface exchange flux and thus directly modulates hyporheic ecological and biogeochemical processes.

Potential reasons of the dramatic degradation include: (1) sediment disconnectivity due to in‐channel weirs; (2) the mobilization effect on gravel of an increased sand supply as a result of earthquake‐induced landslides; and (3) sediment extraction due to intensive mining. In this paper, we study the complex interaction among the above‐mentioned factors in the Shi‐ting River, using a one‐dimensional river morphodynamic model. Simulation results show that in‐channel weirs can reduce bedload transport and lead to bed degradation that is proportional to weir height. When coupled with additional sand supply, the weirs preferentially trap gravel and deliver sand, augmenting the downstream mobility of gravel and thus the degradation. For the Shi‐ting River, the simulated bed degradation agrees well with the observation when an annual sediment mining of 16 million tons is implemented in the simulation, along with the effects of in‐channel weirs and sand supply. The contribution of sediment mining is one order of magnitude larger than the coupling effect of weirs and sand supply. Both the simulation and observation show that the largest bed degradation occurs downstream of the Renmin Weir, due to the large spatial interval between the Renmin Weir and the next grade control structure.

Observations over all land cover types at the regional scale are required to study these turbulent flux dynamics over a landscape. Here, we aim to study how the control of daily and midday latent and sensible heat fluxes over different land cover types is distributed along three axes: energy availability, water availability and exchange efficiency. To this end, observations from 19 eddy covariance flux tower sites in the Netherlands, covering six different land cover types located within the same climatic zone, were used in a regression analysis to explain the observed dynamics and find the principle drivers. The resulting relative position of these sites along the three axes suggests that land cover partly explains the variance of daily and midday turbulent fluxes. We found that evaporation dynamics from grassland, peatland swamp and cropland sites could mostly be explained by energy availability. Forest evaporation can mainly be explained by water availability, urban evaporation by water availability and exchange efficiency, and open water evaporation can almost entirely be explained by exchange efficiency. We found that the sensible heat flux is less sensitive to land cover type. This demonstrates that the land‐atmosphere interface plays an active role in the shedding of sensible heat. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the dynamics of evaporation over different land cover types and may help to optimise, and potentially simplify, models to predict evaporation.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Land cover controls the land-atmosphere exchange of water and energy through the partitioning of solar energy into latent and sensible heat.

Atolls are characterised by a &#39;dual‐aquifer&#39; configuration, where recent Holocene sediments unconformably overlie highly permeable Pleistocene limestone creating an interface called a &#39;Thurber discontinuity.&#39; This study aimed to quantitatively analyse how the dual‐aquifer configuration of atolls controls the temporal dynamics of groundwater flooding caused by storm surges. To this end, we ran surface‐subsurface coupled synthetic numerical simulations using the HydroGeoSphere code and compared 12 scenarios with different Thurber discontinuity elevations and hydraulic conductivities of the Pleistocene aquifer (KP). The results showed that the shallower the Thurber discontinuity and the higher the KP, the higher the maximum water depth in the freshwater swamp on the atoll during the storm surge and the longer the flooding duration. Despite the effects of the different dual‐aquifer configurations, the initial water table elevation and salinity distribution were almost identical in all simulation cases. These findings suggest that accurate information on the dual‐aquifer configuration is necessary to evaluate the potential risk of groundwater flooding in atolls accompanying storm surges. Furthermore, the results indicate that groundwater flooding caused by storm surges substantially contributes to cyclone‐driven flooding on atolls, and hence, it should not be neglected in flood predictions to avoid underestimation.

Atolls are characterised by a &#39;dual-aquifer&#39; configuration, where recent Holocene sediments unconformably overlie highly permeable Pleistocene limestone creating an interface called a &#39;Thurber discontinuity.&#39; This study aimed to quantitatively analyse how the dual-aquifer configuration of atolls controls the temporal dynamics of groundwater flooding caused by storm surges. To this end, we ran surface-subsurface coupled synthetic numerical simulations using the HydroGeoSphere code and compared 12 scenarios with different Thurber discontinuity elevations and hydraulic conductivities of the Pleistocene aquifer (&lt;i>;K&lt;/i>; &lt;sub>;P&lt;/sub>;). The results showed that the shallower the Thurber discontinuity and the higher the &lt;i>;K&lt;/i>; &lt;sub>;P&lt;/sub>;, the higher the maximum water depth in the freshwater swamp on the atoll during the storm surge and the longer the flooding duration. Despite the effects of the different dual-aquifer configurations, the initial water table elevation and salinity distribution were almost identical in all simulation cases. These findings suggest that accurate information on the dual-aquifer configuration is necessary to evaluate the potential risk of groundwater flooding in atolls accompanying storm surges. Furthermore, the results indicate that groundwater flooding caused by storm surges substantially contributes to cyclone-driven flooding on atolls, and hence, it should not be neglected in flood predictions to avoid underestimation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This article is protected by copyright.

Yet, how the displacement dynamics is impacted by the non‐Newtonian rheology remains an open question. Here, we conduct primary drainage experiments in which a shear‐thinning Xanthan gum solution displaces a silicone oil in a transparent rough fracture for a wide range of shear‐thinning property (controlled by polymer concentration) and flow rates. We first evaluate the effects of shear‐thinning property on displacement efficiency. Based on qualitative and quantitative analyses of the observed fluid morphologies, we present an experimental phase diagram of the obtained displacement patterns. We characterize a novel displacement pattern where the fluid‐fluid interface changes from stable (plug flow) to unstable (fingering) as the fracture aperture, averaged over the transverse direction, varies along the mean flow direction. We demonstrate that the existence of this mixed displacement pattern can be explained by local viscosity heterogeneity induced by the coupling of the shear‐thinning behavior and the spatial variability of apertures. Finally, we propose a theoretical model elucidating the mechanisms behind the flow regime transitions. The interface stability criterion predicted by this model exhibits good agreement with the experimental measurements, and stresses the potentially important role of fluid rheology, coupled to aperture variability, in immiscible displacements in rough fractures. These findings provide new insights into the dynamics of immiscible two‐phase flows with non‐Newtonian effects, and has potential implications for the aforementioned engineering applications.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Two-phase flow involving non-Newtonian fluids in fractured media is of vital importance in many natural processes and subsurface engineering applications, such as rock grouting, groundwater remediation, and enhanced oil recovery.

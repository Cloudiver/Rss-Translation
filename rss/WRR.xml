Existing research identifies models&#39; inadequacy to perform during prolonged drought, but falls short on pinpointing which specific aspects of model performance are affected. We study five conceptual rainfall‐runoff models and their performance in 155 Australian catchments which recently experienced a 13‐year long drought.

Representation of shape and variability of hydrograph and flow‐duration curve are more resilient to the prolonged dry climate and rarely more degraded during the multi‐annual drought that on isolated dry years in the pre‐drought record. Conversely, volumetric error suffers from significant exacerbation over the multiple subsequent dry years. This indicates that catchment retention times and rates of storage depletion storage are significantly less affected by the drought than amounts of streamflow produced, pointing to a mismatch between reduction of influxes and out‐fluxes during the drought. We also identify a deficiency of models to delay and remove flow before it reaches the stream and keep track of moisture deficits over multiple dry seasons. By promoting rigorous investigation of models&#39; shortcomings, we hope to foster the development of more robust model structures and/or calibration frameworks to improve applicability within climate change scenarios.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Hydrologic models are essential tools to understand and plan for the effect of changing climates; however, they underperform in transitory climate conditions.

We design a new TDR waveform interpretation model based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that can reveal the spatial variations of soil relative permittivity and water content along a TDR sensor. The proposed model, namely TDR‐CNN, is constructed with three modules. First, the geometrical features of the TDR waveforms are extracted with a simplified version of VGG16 network. Second, the reflection positions in a TDR waveform are traced using a 1D version of the region proposal network. Finally, the soil relative permittivity values are estimated via a CNN regression network. The three modules are developed in Python using Google TensorFlow and Keras API, and then stacked together to formulate the TDR‐CNN architecture. Each module is trained separately, and data transfer among the modules can be facilitated automatically. TDR‐CNN is evaluated using simulated TDR waveforms with varying relative permittivity but under a relatively stable soil electrical conductivity, and the accuracy and stability of the TDR‐CNN are shown. TDR measurements from a water infiltration study provide an application for TDR‐CNN and a comparison between TDR‐CNN and an inverse model. The proposed TDR‐CNN model is simple to implement, and modules in TDR‐CNN can be updated or fine‐tuned individually with new data sets.

Only the vertical component of this flow is indicative of the hydraulic conductivity K, so the algorithm for computing K must include a way of isolating that component from the total flow. Some commonly used formulas correct for the multidimensional effects by subtracting an estimate of the laterally spreading flow. For disks smaller than about 200 mm in diameter, however, lateral spreading constitutes so much of the total flow that these subtractive formulas lose considerable accuracy, and sometimes overcorrect so severely as to produce a negative number for K.

We developed a new formula that uses a multiplicative factor instead of a subtracted term to achieve the needed correction. For testing we conducted numerical experiments with synthetic data produced by solving the Richardson‐Richards equation using the code VS2DRTI, for diverse media and a range of disk sizes, including the widely used 45‐mm diameter. We compared K values calculated from our formula to the actual K used to generate the simulated data, as well as to results from other published formulas.

The clogging can pose serious problems in various practices, such as formation damage in hydrocarbon reservoirs, degradation of fluid withdrawal or injection efficiency, particle‐induced fouling in filtration membranes, or even a risk of sediment failure with geo‐structures. However, the effect of seepage flow velocity on the spatial growth pattern of fines‐induced pore clogging remains poorly identified. This study explores the pore clogging growth behaviors caused by flow‐driven fines migration and accumulation in porous media and the associated permeability reductions through a series of column experiments and concurrent X‐ray computed tomography imaging. Particularly, the X‐ray image analysis captures the spatial distributions of fines, and thus the homogeneous or heterogeneous (localized) clogging growth pattern under various seepage velocities. Our results reveal that an increase in the seepage flow velocity increases the likelihood of localized clogging growth, attributable to the direct interception of fines by the sand grains. The localized clogging growth causes a faster reduction in permeability than the homogeneous clogging growth. The presented study provides well‐controlled experiment data on fines distribution and associated permeability change, which gives insights into fines‐induced clogging behavior in porous media.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Fines migration driven by fluid flows often causes pore clogging in porous media and thus reduces the permeability of the porous media.

This paper presents the scaling of floods (duration, peak, volume) with geomorphologic characteristics of the basin (ie, drainage area, slope, elevation) and precipitation patterns (rainfall accumulation, variability). Long‐term daily streamflow observations over the 20th and early 21st centuries from Hydro‐Climatic Data Network streamgages across the conterminous United States are used to create a flood event database based on their flood stage information. Antecedent daily rainfall accumulation and variability corresponding to these floods are computed using Global Historical Climatology Network daily data set. Two Bayesian scaling models are developed, and the spatial organization of scaling exponents is investigated. The baseline model quantifies the scaling of floods to geomorphologic characteristics. The dynamic model quantifies the scaling of floods to antecedent precipitation distribution which is further conditioned on geomorphologic characteristics. Results show that small and low‐elevation basins have a stronger response to antecedent rainfall distribution in amplifying flood peaks, while high‐elevation steeper basins have a lower response for flood duration and volume. The dynamic models demonstrate that there are significant variations in the flood scaling rates, with the largest rates up to 40% and 4.5% for flood duration, 64% and 44% for peak, and 98% and 40% for volume found across the Northeast, Coastal Southeast, and Northwest with intensifying rainfall accumulation and variability, respectively. This study advances flood predictions by better informing the flood attributes in the context of dynamical land‐atmosphere perturbations.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Accurate flood risk assessment requires a comprehensive understanding of flood sensitivity to regional drivers and climate factors.

Yet, observations that can constrain groundwater residence times over broad timescales remain scarce in mountain catchment studies. We use environmental tracers (CFC‐12, SF6, 3H, and 4He) to investigate groundwater residence times along a hillslope in the East River Watershed, Colorado, USA. We develop a Bayesian inference framework that applies a Markov‐chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to estimate noble gas recharge temperature, elevation, and excess‐air parameters and the resulting environmental tracer concentrations. MCMC is then used to propagate the environmental tracer uncertainties to estimates of groundwater mean residence times inferred with lumped parameter models. All samples contain 3H, CFC‐12, and SF6 in addition to terrigenic 4He, suggesting a mixture of water characterized by modern and premodern residence times. 4He exponential mean residence times range from hundreds of years at the upslope well to thousands of years at the toe‐slope well assuming average crustal production rates. We find that binary mixing residence time distributions with separate young and old mixing fractions are needed to predict the 4He, CFC‐12, SF6, and 3H observations, supporting the importance of flow path mixing in this bedrock system. Our findings that the fractured bedrock hosts groundwater with a mixture of residence times ranging from decades to millennia suggest variable recharge dynamics and flow path mixing along the hillslope and highlight the importance of characterizing groundwater systems with observations that are sensitive to transport over a broad range of residence times.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Groundwater residence time distributions provide fundamental insights on the hydrological processes within watersheds.

We explore the use of stable isotopes of water to evaluate the effects of agricultural reservoirs on hydrology and the sustainable use of water in the arid Shiyang River basin. Results show that agricultural large‐ and medium‐sized reservoirs in this arid region alter local isotopic hydrologic patterns increasing water‐body evaporation and enriching the isotopic composition of water near the reservoir. As a result, evaporation losses of reservoir water can be as high as 30.7% in downstream desert reservoirs. Reservoir water also exchanges with surrounding groundwater and contributes 22% to local precipitation due to reservoir evaporation. Detailed studies of individual reservoirs show that the isotopic composition is most enriched at the surface of the reservoir and then gradually depletes toward the bottom.

Shallow groundwaters are inherently susceptible to contamination from land‐use and surface water intrusion threatening drinking water usage. We used a large‐scale snapshot data set of stable water isotopes from shallow glaciofluvial aquifers used for drinking water supply in Northern Finland to assess surface water intrusion risks and recharge conditions. This data set was supplemented by long‐term stable water isotope precipitation data, Geographic Information System proximity analysis and multivariate statistics. The isotope analysis suggest that a warm season contributes about 60% to the total annual precipitation in the region.

It is generally addressed using detailed hydrologic‐hydrodynamic simulations or simple, empirically‐based indices. The former provide detailed results, at the cost of a large amount of information and high computational efforts; the latter are cost‐effective and simple, yet they generally provide approximate results. A promising compromise between the two is the physically‐based attenuation index ℛ, based on the concept of equivalent reservoir; ℛ was recently proposed in the literature to estimate the impact of multiple reservoirs located in series along the main channel, based on the assumption of rectangular catchment. In this work, we extend the equivalent reservoir approach to a generic catchment, with any shape and without restrictions on the location of the reservoirs. For an effective assessment of the method, we also introduce the novel concept of Reservoir‐influenced Instantaneous Unit Hydrograph (RIUH); the RIUH can be derived using a Monte Carlo procedure to include the effects of reservoirs on the IUH. Simulations of numerous fictitious reservoir configurations in a real basin demonstrate the potential of the methods in reproducing the attenuation effect. Remarkably, an average error of 3 − 5% exists between ℛ and the peak reduction of a less simplified reality (RIUH). Finally, we provide a global, catchment‐scale application of the attenuation index, which constitutes an effective tool for the evaluation of each reservoir in managed catchment system and the design or planning of new hydraulic infrastructures.

A basic discrete fracture geometry, including orientations, lengths and positions of fractures, is generated from an MS events cloud by minimizing the distance between fractures and MS events. This geometric configuration, together with the aperture, is then further adjusted, based on the reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, to minimize the misfit between observed and calculated thermal breakthrough curves by iterative forward flow and heat transport modeling. The inversion model is applied to two synthetic test cases. Following the sensitivity analysis of temperatures to fracture parameters, and the robustness analysis on the model performance under supportive data featuring good and poor quality, it is confirmed that the probabilistic joint inversion procedure approximates the fracture geometry and aperture well, and errors in predicting temperatures based on realizations of fracture networks are well below 5%. The methodology provides a new way to characterize fracture networks in the subsurface, without restrictions on predetermined fracture sizes or the number of fractures.&lt;/p>;</content:encoded><dc:creator> Zhenjiao Jiang, Lisa Maria Ringel, Peter Bayer, Tianfu Xu</dc:creator><category> Research Article</category><dc:title> Fracture Network Characterization in Reservoirs by Joint Inversion of Microseismicity and Thermal Breakthrough Data: Method Development and Verification</dc:title><dc:identifier> 10.1029/2022WR034339</dc:identifier><prism:publicationname> Water Resources Research</prism:publicationname><prism:doi> 10.1029/2022WR034339</prism:doi><prism:url> https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022WR034339?af=R</prism:url><prism:section> Research Article</prism:section><prism:volume> 59</prism:volume><prism:number> 9</prism:number></item><item><link/> https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR034460?af=R<pubDate> Wed, 06 Sep 2023 13:14:16 -0700</pubDate><dc:date> 2023-09-06T01:14:16-07:00</dc:date><source url="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/19447973?af=R"/> Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents<prism:coverdate> Fri, 01 Sep 2023 00:00:00 -0700</prism:coverdate><prism:coverdisplaydate> Fri, 01 Sep 2023 00:00:00 -0700</prism:coverdisplaydate><guid ispermalink="false"> 10.1029/2023WR034460</guid><title> Combining Daily Sensor Observations and Spatial LiDAR Data for Mapping Snow Water Equivalent in a Sub‐Alpine Forest</title><description> Water Resources Research, Volume 59, Issue 9, September 2023.</description><dc:description> Abstract Snow interacts with its environment in many ways and thus has a highly heterogeneous spatial and temporal variability. Therefore, modeling snow variability is difficult, especially in forested environments. To increase the understanding of the spatio‐temporal variability of snow and to validate snow models, reliable observation data at similar spatial and temporal scales is needed. For these purposes, airborne LiDAR surveys or time series derived from ground‐based snow sensors are commonly used. However, these are limited either to one point in space or in time. A new, extensive data set of daily snow variability in a sub‐alpine forest in the Alptal valley, Switzerland is presented. The core data set consists of a dense sensor network, repeated high‐resolution LiDAR data acquired using a fixed‐wing UAV, and manual snow depth and snow density measurements. Using machine learning algorithms, four distinct spatial clusters of similar snow depth dynamics are determined. By combining these spatial clusters with the observed snow depth time series, daily high‐resolution maps of snow depth and snow water equivalent (SWE) are derived. These products are the first to our knowledge that provide spatio‐temporally continuous snow depth and SWE based almost exclusively on field data. The presented workflow is transferrable to different regions, climates and scales. Moreover, the results allow future field campaigns to find representative sensor locations and target their LiDAR surveys to derive similar continuous products with less involved effort.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Snow interacts with its environment in many ways and thus has a highly heterogeneous spatial and temporal variability.

However, the effect of Gc on Ew exhibits diversity across time dimensions. The controls on Gc and the effects of Gc on Ew estimates at different time scales remain largely unexplored. To address these gaps, we identified the primary controls on Gc at an eddy covariance site in a large shallow lake (Lake Taihu) and quantified the role of Gc in estimating Ew on three (hourly, daily, and monthly) time scales based on two energy balance‐based Ew models. Our results indicate that the diurnal variation of Gc is dominated by net radiation and peaks around noon, while the seasonal variation of Gc is mainly controlled by air temperature and peaks in spring. In contrast, the daily variation of Gc is subjective to a confluence of factors—net radiation, wind speed, and relative humidity—displaying more stochasticity than that on the other two time scales. We also found that the importance of Gc for Ew estimates decreases as the time scale extends. Compared to the two models disregarding Gc, considering the effect of Gc enhances the average Kling‐Gupta efficiency (KGE) values of the two models by 1.33, 0.42, and 0.08 on the three time scales, respectively.

The basis of the method relies on two analytical solutions of the nonlinear Boussinesq equation: one applies to a uniform water table profile in a semi‐infinite aquifer while the other pertains to a hypothetical initial profile in a finite aquifer. Both solutions assume that the water depth in the adjoining stream is negligible. In the present work, a nonlinear solution of the one‐dimensional Boussinesq equation is derived using the traveling wave approximation. The solution better represents the field conditions as it pertains to a uniform water table profile in a finite aquifer that is adjoining a stream with a non‐zero water level. It allows the derivation of simple algebraic expressions for the recession of the water table, the flow rate, and the associated drainage volume. Approximations relating the discharge rate to the outflow volume were also obtained for practical implementation in the estimation of the hydraulic parameters of the aquifer. A comparison of the proposed methodology of parameter estimation with the standard method of recession analysis showed that the present approach is superior as it avoids the pitfalls associated with the classical method, especially when daily discharge values with inherent observational errors are used. Application of the recession model to real‐world cases demonstrates its effectiveness in the estimation of the catchment‐scale hydraulic conductivity and drainable porosity.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Recession analysis is a powerful tool for determining the hydraulic characteristics of a riparian aquifer.

However, regionalization also brings new challenges to water supply planning. Successful regionalization policies must equitably balance the interests of multiple partners while navigating power relationships between regional actors. In long‐term infrastructure planning contexts, this challenge is heightened by the evolving system‐state dynamics, which may be fundamentally reshaped by infrastructure investment. This work introduces Equitable, Robust, Adaptive, and Stable Deeply Uncertain Pathways (DU PathwaysERAS), an exploratory modeling framework for developing regional water supply management and infrastructure investment pathways. DU PathwaysERAS provides an integrated framework for stakeholders to evaluate the equity of policy outcomes across cooperating partners and explore regional power relationships within cooperative infrastructure policies. To capture the time‐evolving dynamics of infrastructure pathways, DU PathwaysERAS features new tools to measure the adaptive capacity of pathway policies and evaluate time‐evolving vulnerability. We demonstrate our framework on a six‐utility water supply partnership seeking to develop cooperative infrastructure investment pathways in the Research Triangle, North Carolina. Our results indicate that commonly employed framings of robustness can have large and unintended adverse consequences for regional partnerships. Results further illustrate that regional and individual vulnerabilities are highly interdependent and emphasize the need to limit counterparty risks through carefully designed cooperative agreements. Beyond the Research Triangle, these results are broadly applicable to cooperative water supply infrastructure investment and management globally.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Regionalization approaches—where utilities in close geographic proximity cooperate to manage drought risks and co-invest in new infrastructure—are increasingly necessary strategies for leveraging economies of scale to meet growing demands and navigate financial risks.

However, evidence shows that the equilibrium fractionation between liquid water and water vapor within the soil is affected not only by soil temperature but also by soil tension. How soil tension affects isotope transport modeling and interpretations of the RWU origin is still unknown. In this study, we evaluated three fractionation scenarios on model performance for a field data set from Langeoog Island: (a) no fractionation (Non_Frac), (b) the soil temperature control on equilibrium fractionation as described by the standard Craig‐Gordon equation (CG_Frac), and (c) CG_Frac plus the soil tension control on equilibrium fractionation (CGT_Frac). The model simulations showed that CGT_Frac led to more depleted isotopic compositions of surface soil water than CG_Frac. The vertical origin of RWU was estimated using the water balance (WB) calculations and the Bayesian mixing model (SIAR). While the former directly used water flow outputs, the latter used as input simulated isotopic compositions (using different fractionation scenarios) of RWU and soil water. Both methods provided similar variation trends with time and depth in different soil layers&#39; contributions to RWU. The contributions of all soil layers interpreted by the CGT_Frac scenario were always between Non_Frac and CG_Frac. The temporal origin of RWU was deduced from particle tracking (PT, releasing one hypothetical particle for individual precipitation event and tracking its movement based on the water balance between particles) and a virtual tracer experiment (VTE, assigning a known isotope composition to individual precipitation event and tracking its movement based on the cumulative isotope flux). Both methods revealed similar variation trends with time in drainage and root zone (RZ) travel times. The interpreted drainage and RZ travel times were generally ranked as Non_Frac >; CGT_Frac >; CG_Frac.

In particular for finer time scales, changes in water storage, which has been commonly neglected for long‐term temporal scales, may play an important role on hydrological processes. Nevertheless, few studies addressed this question in modifying the Budyko framework, with most of them remaining a steady‐state assumption on catchment characteristics. Here, we derive new analytical formulas of unsteady‐state streamflow elasticity in a modified Budyko framework, incorporating both storage change and one specific parameter for catchment properties. We study 78 humid catchments in the USA with simulation data of daily hydrological processes from a probability‐distribution‐based hydrological model (the modified HyMOD). As indicated by results, the annual storage change ratio is linearly correlated with the annual aridity index, and this relationship can be used to estimate elasticity coefficients with our formulas. The estimated elasticity coefficients perform well in simulating the annual streamflow with the power‐law model. For different catchments, variability of the unsteady‐state elasticity is higher than that of the steady‐state elasticity. Unsteady‐state streamflow coefficients show significant linear correlation with catchment properties, such as the average slope, average elevation, and catchment area. This study provides a new analytical approach to investigate the interannual stability of catchments with varying climate and catchment properties.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The changes in climate and catchment properties have altered the hydrological processes significantly at different spatiotemporal scales around the world. In particular for finer time scales, changes in water storage, which has been commonly neglected for long-term temporal scales, may play an important role on hydrological processes. Nevertheless, few studies addressed this question in modifying the Budyko framework, with most of them remaining a steady-state assumption on catchment characteristics. Here, we derive new analytical formulas of unsteady-state streamflow elasticity in a modified Budyko framework, incorporating both storage change and one specific parameter for catchment properties. We study 78 humid catchments in the USA with simulation data of daily hydrological processes from a probability-distribution-based hydrological model (the modified HyMOD). As indicated by results, the annual storage change ratio is linearly correlated with the annual aridity index, and this relationship can be used to estimate elasticity coefficients with our formulas. The estimated elasticity coefficients perform well in simulating the annual streamflow with the power-law model. For different catchments, variability of the unsteady-state elasticity is higher than that of the steady-state elasticity. Unsteady-state streamflow coefficients show significant linear correlation with catchment properties, such as the average slope, average elevation, and catchment area. This study provides a new analytical approach to investigate the interannual stability of catchments with varying climate and catchment properties.&lt;/p>;</content:encoded><dc:creator> Peng‐Fei Han, Arumugam Sankarasubramanian, Xu‐Sheng Wang, Li Wan, Lili Yao</dc:creator><category> Research Article</category><dc:title> One‐Parameter Analytical Derivation in Modified Budyko Framework for Unsteady‐State Streamflow Elasticity in Humid Catchments</dc:title><dc:identifier> 10.1029/2023WR034725</dc:identifier><prism:publicationname> Water Resources Research</prism:publicationname><prism:doi> 10.1029/2023WR034725</prism:doi><prism:url> https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR034725?af=R</prism:url><prism:section> Research Article</prism:section><prism:volume> 59</prism:volume><prism:number> 9</prism:number></item><item><link/> https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022WR032831?af=R<pubDate> Fri, 01 Sep 2023 08:26:00 -0700</pubDate><dc:date> 2023-09-01T08:26:00-07:00</dc:date><source url="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/19447973?af=R"/> Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents<prism:coverdate> Fri, 01 Sep 2023 00:00:00 -0700</prism:coverdate><prism:coverdisplaydate> Fri, 01 Sep 2023 00:00:00 -0700</prism:coverdisplaydate><guid ispermalink="false"> 10.1029/2022WR032831</guid><title> Defining Renewable Groundwater Use and Its Relevance to Sustainable Groundwater Management</title><description> Water Resources Research, Volume 59, Issue 9, September 2023.</description><dc:description> Abstract Groundwater systems are commonly defined as renewable or non‐renewable based on natural fluxes of recharge or on estimates of aquifer storage and groundwater residence time. However, we show here that the principle of capture (ie, how recharge and discharge change due to pumping) challenges simple definitions so that a groundwater system cannot be renewable or non‐renewable in and of itself, but only with reference to how the groundwater is being used. We develop and propose more hydraulically informed definitions for flux‐renewable and storage‐renewable groundwater use, and a combined definition that encompasses both the flux‐based and storage‐based perspectives such that: renewable groundwater use allows for dynamically stable re‐equilibrium of groundwater levels and quality on human timescales. Further, we show how a matrix of combinations of (a) the ratio of pumping rate to the maximum rate of capture along with (b) the response or recovery timescales implicit in this definition, leads to a useful four‐quadrant framework for characterizing groundwater use, illustrated using case studies from aquifers around the world. Renewable groundwater use may inform pathways to groundwater sustainability, which encompasses a broader set of dimensions (eg, socio‐political, economic, ecological and cultural) beyond the scope of groundwater science. We propose that separating physically robust definitions of renewable groundwater use from the inherently value‐based language of sustainability, can help bring much needed clarity to wider discussions about sustainable groundwater management strategies, and the role of groundwater science and scientists in such endeavors.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Groundwater systems are commonly defined as renewable or non-renewable based on natural fluxes of recharge or on estimates of aquifer storage and groundwater residence time.

The reduced order model of the advective‐dispersive heat transport in the fracture‐matrix system is resulted from the Reynolds decomposition. The model allows the calculations of the upscaled dispersion and advection terms. A simple scaling relation is developed to estimate heat extraction from geothermal fracture‐matrix systems. It was shown that the extracted heat is inversely proportional to the height of the matrix squared. Our finding also revealed that the dimensionless extracted heat is weakly dependent on fracture Peclet number and matrix Darcy number and is threefold the matrix dimensionless thermal diffusion time. In the analysis presented, we assumed a homogenous system. The heterogeneity caused by a variation in fracture and rock matrix properties (such as porosity, permeability, thickness, and aperture) adds more complexity. Including these complexities in the determination of the thermal dispersion with the coupled fracture‐matrix approach needs further investigation. However, the developed model, along with the findings of this study, provides valuable insight into the physics of thermal energy extraction from fractured geothermal reservoirs and can be used for testing the underlying hypotheses in real‐field applications.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;We studied thermal dispersion in a fracture walled by a porous and permeable rock matrix, where the fluid flow and heat transport are coupled across the interface between these media.

Recent studies have shown that the motility and gyrotaxis of algae could greatly influence their transport in waters. However, little attention has been paid to the initial and transient transport regime when the classical Taylor dispersion model is not applicable. To tackle this problem, we resort to Gill&#39;s generalized dispersion model for passive particles like solute, which has the potential for accurately describing the entire transport process. For the first time, we extend Gill&#39;s model to the active particles, and the effects of swimming, gyrotaxis, and flow shear on the microorganism dispersion in an open‐channel flow have been thoroughly investigated. We first theoretically solve the transient drift and dispersion coefficients, based on which we obtain analytical solutions for concentration distributions of microorganisms, and further validate these results by numerically solving the governing equation. We find that when there is no flow, the longitudinal dispersion of microorganisms can be weakened by the gravitactic accumulation in the vicinity of water surface, while enhanced by a stronger swimming ability of the microorganisms. The effect of the flow shear does not affect the form of the asymptotic concentration distribution, but can greatly enhance the transient drift velocity and the dispersivity. We further analyze the effect of turbulence on microorganisms&#39; dispersion by combing the direct numerical simulation and the random walk simulation. The increase of turbulence is shown to decrease the vertical non‐uniformity of the concentration distribution, as well as the relative contribution of active behavior to both the drift and Taylor dispersivity during transport.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The rich and complex phenomena of the transport of active particles like microorganisms in shear flows are of great significance to various biological and environmental applications.

These proxies are useful for projecting how sea‐level rise (SLR) will increase the frequency of coastal flooding. However, tide gauges do not account for land‐based sources of coastal flooding and therefore flood thresholds and the proxies derived from them likely underestimate the current and future frequency of coastal flooding. Here we present a new sensor framework for measuring the incidence of coastal floods that captures both subterranean and land‐based contributions to flooding. The low‐cost, open‐source sensor framework consists of a storm drain water level sensor, roadway camera, and wireless gateway that transmit data in real‐time. During 5 months of deployment in the Town of Beaufort, North Carolina, 24 flood events were recorded. Twenty‐Five percentage of those events were driven by land‐based sources—rainfall, combined with moderate high tides and reduced capacity in storm drains. Consequently, we find that flood frequency is higher than that suggested by proxies that rely exclusively on tide gauge water levels for determining flood incidence. This finding likely extends to other locations where stormwater networks are at a reduced drainage capacity due to SLR. Our results highlight the benefits of instrumenting SW networks directly to capture multiple drivers of coastal flooding. More accurate estimates of the frequency and drivers of floods in low‐lying coastal communities can enable the development of more effective long‐term adaptation strategies.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Tide gauge water levels are commonly used as a proxy for flood incidence on land.

Although streamflow signals result from processes with different frequencies, they can be “sparse” or have a “lower‐dimensional” representation in a transformed feature space. In such cases, if this appropriate feature space can be identified from streamflow data in gauged watersheds by dimensionality reduction, streamflow in poorly gauged watersheds can be predicted with a few measurements taken. This study utilized this framework, named data‐driven sparse sensing (DSS), to predict daily‐scale streamflow in 543 watersheds across the contiguous United States. A tailored library of features was extracted from streamflow training data in watersheds within the same climatic region, and this feature space was used to reconstruct streamflow in poorly gauged watersheds and identify the optimal timings for measurement. Among different regions, streamflow in snowmelt‐dominated and baseflow‐dominated watersheds (eg, Rocky Mountains) was more effectively predicted with fewer streamflow measurements taken. The prediction efficiency in some rainfall‐dominated regions, eg, New England and the Pacific coast, increased significantly with an increasing number of measurements. The spatial variability of prediction efficiency can be attributed to the process‐driven mechanisms and the dimensionality of watershed dynamics. Storage‐dominated systems are lower‐dimensional and more predictable than rainfall‐dominated systems. Measurements taken during periods with large streamflow magnitudes and/or variances are more informative and lead to better predictions. This study demonstrates that DSS can be an especially useful technique to integrate ground‐based measurements with remotely sensed data for streamflow prediction, sensor placement, and watershed classification.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Many rivers and streams are ungauged or poorly gauged and predicting streamflow in such watersheds is challenging.

This study demonstrates that DSS can be an especially useful technique to integrate ground-based measurements with remotely sensed data for streamflow prediction, sensor placement, and watershed classification.&lt;/p>;</content:encoded><dc:creator> Kun Zhang, Mitul Luhar, Manuela I.

Besides, higher variability in precipitation linked to the variability of scPDIS also shortened the forecast lead time. To appraise the applicability of the suggested forecast model to drought management planning, drought characteristics (ie, severity, duration, area) were obtained by the three‐dimensional drought clustering algorithm for the forecasted and observed scPDSI.

In this study, an analytical solution is derived to describe the drawdown variation in a nonlinear‐consolidated aquitard under the condition of variable drawdowns in adjacent aquifers.

The main controlling parameters of step formation and stability are hydraulic forcing, sediment transport, and granular effects (ie, grain‐grain interlocking, jamming). Previous studies found macrorough sidewalls to further increase bed stability due to grain‐sidewall interlocking but the effect of the reduced bed shear stress caused by sidewall friction was not explicitly considered. The present study aims at untangling hydraulic effects induced by the macrorough sidewalls and granular effects, that is, grain‐sidewall interaction. Flume experiments with five types of macrorough sidewalls were conducted under clear‐water conditions for bed slopes ranging between 4% and 10% and jamming ratios 5.3 &lt; Wm/d84 &lt; 11.2, where Wm is the mean channel width and d84 is a characteristic grain size of the sediment mixture. A modified sidewall correction procedure accounting for sidewall friction was applied to estimate bed shear stress. Bed stability considerably increased with increasing sidewall roughness. The dimensionless bed shear stress θRb controlled step occurrence as the system evolved toward a state of a maximum number of steps for critical Shields ratios θRb/θc ≈ 1. Contrary to the expectations, fewer steps formed in the roughest sidewall experiments as few very stable steps inhibited sediment relocation and therewith step formation. Steps were more frequently located in the constrictions caused by the macrorough elements and sustained higher bed shear stress increments. Overall, hydraulic effects fully explained the increase in bed stability in moderately rough sidewall experiments whereas granular effects became important in channels with strong local constrictions.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;A step-pool bed morphology often develops in steep mountain streams.

These markets facilitate trading of water among many users and across multiple connected regions. Increasingly, these markets also support intertemporal transfers via the carryover of user water allocations within public water storages. While trading can improve the spatial allocation of water, carryover can improve the temporal allocation by ensuring storage reserves reflect prevailing user supply and reliability preferences. This paper presents an economic model of water markets and irrigated agriculture in the southern Murray‐Darling Basin. A reduced‐form statistical model of water demand is estimated using historical irrigation and water market data. This statistical model is placed within an economic partial‐equilibrium framework accounting for both inter‐regional trade and inter‐year carryover. The model is solved numerically for a dynamic market equilibrium given assumptions over future stochastic water supplies. Out‐of‐sample tests show the model can realistically simulate water market prices and irrigation activity across the basin. The model is applied to estimate the economic benefits of inter‐regional water trading and inter‐year carryover. Results show around a third of the economic benefits of water markets in the region can be attributed to inter‐year carryover.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Within the Australian southern Murray-Darling Basin water markets have become a key institutional response to water scarcity and environmental problems.

Results show around a third of the economic benefits of water markets in the region can be attributed to inter-year carryover.&lt;/p>;</content:encoded><dc:creator> Neal Hughes, Mihir Gupta, Linden Whittle, Tim Westwood</dc:creator><category> Research Article</category><dc:title> An economic model of spatial and temporal water trade in the Australian southern Murray‐Darling Basin</dc:title><dc:identifier> 10.1029/2022WR032559</dc:identifier><prism:publicationname> Water Resources Research</prism:publicationname><prism:doi> 10.1029/2022WR032559</prism:doi><prism:url> https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022WR032559?af=R</prism:url><prism:section> Research Article</prism:section></item><item><link/> https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022WR034211?af=R<pubDate> Tue, 28 Mar 2023 11:37:05 -0700</pubDate><dc:date> 2023-03-28T11:37:05-07:00</dc:date><source url="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/19447973?af=R"/> Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents <prism:coverdate></prism:coverdate><prism:coverdisplaydate></prism:coverdisplaydate><guid ispermalink="false"> 10.1029/2022WR034211</guid><title> New insights into freezing behavior of saturated and air‐entrained porous media via a micromechanics‐based thermo‐hydro‐mechanical model</title><description> Water Resources Research, Accepted Article.</description><dc:description> Abstract A micromechanics‐based thermo‐hydro‐mechanical model for capturing the freezing behavior of porous media is devised, where a microstructure‐dependent constitutive relation, thermo‐hydro‐mechanical conditions, and the origin of freezing deformation are comprehensively considered.

The results show that the two cross‐correlations between the pumping well and the observation well reach their maximums before pumping reaches a steady state. Specifically, the cross‐correlation between the observed head and hydraulic conductivity is the greatest when the temporal derivative of the observed head does not change significantly, and that between the observed head and specific storage is the greatest when the temporal derivative (the rate) of the observed head is maximum. Based on the results of cross‐correlation analysis, a short‐term pumping strategy for HT is proposed to obtain the spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity and specific storage using the successive linear estimator. Furthermore, this strategy was validated by Monte Carlo simulations. This paper points out that the sensitivity and cross‐correlation analyses report the ensemble (averaged) behaviors of any heterogeneous aquifers, which is not necessarily suitable for one realization. Furthermore, Monte Carlo simulation is suggested for validating any groundwater inverse modeling result. This article is protected by copyright.

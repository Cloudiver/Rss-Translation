Water risks stem from biophysical dimensions of groundwater depletion, low surface water flows, and degraded quality, and, contextual dimensions of regulatory uncertainty, public concerns and perception. While academic, policy, and practitioner interest is growing, literature reveals major gaps in comprehensive assessment of multi-dimensional water risks at the sub-watershed scale. Addressing these gaps, the study developed a locally-attuned and interdisciplinary water risk assessment framework. Using secondary mixed data analysis, the study integrated quantitative and qualitative data for water quantity and quality risks, regulatory trends, water user conflicts for 38 sub-watersheds in Ontario. The framework identifies sub-watersheds and sectors at high, moderate, and low risk along with media and public concern themes. The study finds high and moderate risk potential in at least 50% of studied sub-watersheds for all water risk indicators and challenges the myth of water abundance in Great Lakes watershed of Ontario. The study advances knowledge in water risk assessment by applying social ecological perspectives, interdisciplinary approaches of Risk Theory, and mixed methods to provide a comprehensive evaluation of water security and demonstrates integration of social science perspectives in the field of socio-hydrology. Our framework assesses interdisciplinary water risks to inform multi-sector sustainable water management decisions. While spatially scoped to populous sub-watersheds of Ontario, this framework can be methodologically generalized to other geographical regions by using local data.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This article is protected by copyright.

Here, we propose a continuum model that resolves the nonlinear coupling of preferential melt flow and the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of ice‐melt phase change at the Darcy scale. We assume that the commonly observed unstable melt infiltration is due to the gravity fingering instability and capture it using the modified Richards equation, which is extended with a higher‐order term in saturation. Our model accounts for changes in porosity and the thermal budget of the snowpack caused by melt refreezing at the continuum scale, based on a mechanistic estimate of the ice‐water phase change kinetics formulated at the pore scale. We validate the model in 1D against field data and laboratory experiments of infiltration in snow and find generally good agreement. Compared to existing theory of stable melt infiltration, our 2D simulation results show that preferential infiltration delivers melt faster to deeper depths, and as a result, changes in porosity and temperature can occur at deeper parts of the snow. The simulations also capture the formation of vertical low porosity annulus known as ice pipes, which have been observed in the field but lack mechanistic understanding to date. Our results demonstrate how melt refreezing and unstable infiltration reshape the porosity structure of snow and impacts thermal and mass transport in highly nonlinear ways that are not captured by simpler models.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The transport of meltwater through porous snow is a fundamental process in hydrology that remains poorly understood but essential for more robust predictions of how the cryosphere will respond under climate change.

Despite numerous progress in modeling flow and transport over the past decades, we are still far from accurately estimating the scale dependence of soil and rock properties. In this study, we propose applying renormalization group theory (RGT) at the pore scale. Using the RGT, we determine the scale dependence of effective pore‐throat radius (rteff) and develop two theoretical models to estimate permeability (k) in pore networks of various sizes. The first theoretical model estimates k(L) from the rteff(L) and simulated formation factor F(L), while the second model uses information at the smallest scale (L = Lmin) in addition to rteff(L) and F(L). By comparing with 25 pore‐network simulations, we show that the RGT estimates the scale‐dependent k reasonably well. The first model estimates k(L) with average relative errors ranged between −53.1% and −3.0%, while the second model between −1.0% and 14.33%. We also conduct fluid flow simulations in 40 other pore networks above the representative elementary volume and compare the results of the RGT with those of the effective‐medium approximation (EMA). Results showed that both RGT and EMA accurately estimate k from pore‐throat radius distribution and formation factor with root mean square log‐transformed error = 0.119 and 0.096, respectively.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Investigating hydraulic and petrophysical properties of porous media has been an active area of research.

By comparing with 25 pore-network simulations, we show that the RGT estimates the scale-dependent &lt;i>;k&lt;/i>; reasonably well. The first model estimates &lt;i>;k&lt;/i>;(&lt;i>;L&lt;/i>;) with average relative errors ranged between −53.1% and −3.0%, while the second model between −1.0% and 14.33%. We also conduct fluid flow simulations in 40 other pore networks above the representative elementary volume and compare the results of the RGT with those of the effective-medium approximation (EMA). Results showed that both RGT and EMA accurately estimate &lt;i>;k&lt;/i>; from pore-throat radius distribution and formation factor with root mean square log-transformed error = 0.119 and 0.096, respectively.&lt;/p>;</content:encoded><dc:creator> Misagh Esmaeilpour, Behzad Ghanbarian, Rita Sousa, Peter R.

Here, we developed an analytical plant hydraulics scheme wherein hydraulic capacitances at the leaf level and stem level were considered, and incorporated it into the Vegetation Interface Processes Model (VIP‐PHS). Then, we calibrated the VIP‐PHS parameters using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method and conducted an ecosystem‐scale evaluation of the VIP‐PHS at 30 FLUXNET sites. The results showed that VIP‐PHS improved evapotranspiration (ET) and gross primary production (GPP) simulations across the studied sites, reducing the root mean square error (RMSE) by 0.02–0.27 mm day‐1 and 0.04–0.52 g C m‐2 day‐1 in relation to the empirical soil hydraulics schemes (hereafter, VIP‐SHS). VIP‐PHS decreased the RMSE in ET and GPP by up to 45% and 55% in evergreen needleleaf forests. Compared to VIP‐SHS, VIP‐PHS decreased the sensitivities of ET and GPP to soil moisture stress, and significantly improved ET and GPP predictions under low soil moisture conditions. The sensitivity analysis showed that larger stem hydraulics capacitance better relieved xylem water stress, resulting in greater transpiration and GPP and less‐negative daily minimum stem water potential.

This study demonstrates that CR models with distributed parameters have a promising future in estimating basin or regional evaporation. An integrated spatial and temporal evaluation framework can better distinguish the performance of CR models.

Despite this, reservoirs are frequently excluded or poorly represented in large‐scale hydrological models, which can be partly attributed to a lack of open‐access data describing reservoir operations, inflow and storage. To help inform the development of reservoir operation schemes, we collate a suite of hydrological signatures designed to detect the impacts of reservoirs on the flow regime at large‐scales from downstream flow records only. By removing the need for pre‐and‐post‐reservoir flow timeseries (a requirement of many pre‐existing techniques), these signatures facilitate the assessment of flow alteration across a much wider range of catchments. To demonstrate their application, we calculate the signatures across Great Britain in 111 benchmark (ie near‐natural) catchments and 186 reservoir catchments (where at least one upstream reservoir is present). We find that abstractions from water resource reservoirs induce deficits in the water balance, and that pre‐defined flow releases (eg the compensation flow) reduce variability in the downstream flow duration curve and in intra‐annual low flows. By comparing signatures in benchmark and reservoir catchments, we define thresholds above which the influence of reservoirs can be distinguished from natural variability and identify 40 catchments significantly impacted by the presence of reservoirs. The signatures also provide insights into local reservoir operations, which can inform the development of tailored reservoir operation schemes, and identify locations where current modelling practices (which lack reservoir representation) will be insufficient.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Reservoirs play a vital role in the supply and management of water resources and their operation can significantly alter downstream flow.

We highlight here that HAND is limited to producing inundation only when sourced from its nearest flowpath, thus lacks the ability to source inundation from multiple fluvial sources. A version of HAND, known as Generalized Mainstems (GMS), is proposed that discretizes a target stream network into segments of unit Horton‐Strahler stream order known as level paths (LPs). The FIMs associated with each independent LP are then mosaiced together, effectively turning the stream network into discrete groups of homogeneous unit stream order by removing the influence of neighboring tributaries. Improvement in mapping skill is observed by significantly reducing false negatives at river junctions when the inundation extents are compared to FIMs from that of benchmarks. A more marginal reduction in the false alarm rate is also observed due to a shift introduced in the stage‐discharge relationship by increasing the size of the catchments. We observe that the improvement of this method applied at 4%–5% of the entire stream network to 100% of the network is about the same magnitude improvement as going from no drainage order reduction to 4%–5% of the network. This novel contribution is framed in a new open‐source implementation that utilizes the latest combination of hydro‐conditioning techniques to enforce drainage and counter limitations in the input data.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND), a drainage normalizing terrain index, is a means able of producing flood inundation maps (FIMs) from the National Water Model (NWM) at large scales and high resolutions using reach-averaged synthetic rating curves.

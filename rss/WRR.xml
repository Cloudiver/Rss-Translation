However, observations of near-surface wind are typically spatially sparse. The use of these sparse wind fields to force distributed models, such as hydrological models, is greatly complicated in complex terrain, such as mountain headwaters basins. In these regions, wind flows are heavily impacted by overlapping influences of terrain at different scales. This can have a great impact on calculations of evapotranspiration, snowmelt, and blowing snow transport and sublimation. The use of high-resolution atmospheric models allows for numerical weather prediction (NWP) model outputs to be dynamically downscaled. However, the computation burden for large spatial extents and long periods of time often precludes their use. Here, a wind-library approach is presented to aid in downscaling NWP outputs and terrain-correcting spatially interpolated observations. This approach preserves important spatial characteristics of the flow field at a fraction of the computational costs of even the simplest high-resolution atmospheric models. This approach improves on previous implementations by: scaling to large spatial extents O(1M km&lt;sup>;2&lt;/sup>;); approximating lee-side effects; and fully automating the creation of the wind library. Overall, this approach was shown to have a 3rd quartile RMSE of 1.8 &lt;i>;m&lt;/i>; ⋅ &lt;i>;s&lt;/i>; &lt;sup>;−1&lt;/sup>; and a 3rd quartile RMSE of 58.2° versus a standalone diagnostic windflow model. The wind velocity estimates versus observations were better than existing empirical terrain-based estimates and computational savings were approximately 100-fold versus the diagnostic model.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This article is protected by copyright.

Radon (222Rn) has been widely used as a natural geochemical tracer to quantify SGD, but field measurements are time consuming and costly. Here, we use deep learning to predict coastal seawater radon in SGD‐impacted regions.

We present two alternatives to the two‐source evapotranspiration (ET) model, which utilize a more accurate approximation of the Clausius‐Clapeyron relation. Model performance was evaluated through a comparison with observed half‐hourly eddy covariance fluxes. Modeled representations of sensible heat dynamics and the limiting behaviors were also evaluated to identify the causes of model inaccuracies. Our analysis shows that the new exponential approximation used here significantly reduces errors that stem from solutions to the energy balance equations. The proposed parallel and series models are both more accurate than the Shuttleworth‐Wallace (SW) model under the conditions evaluated here, but we cannot conclude that the new models are consistently more accurate over a broader range of conditions. The new models can correctly reproduce several theoretical limiting behaviors, whereas the SW model generates conceptually incorrect results for several important limiting cases in which some key conductances approach both zero and infinity. Importantly, these models seriously underestimate the observed latent heat fluxes at night; the major causes of the nighttime model inadequacies are thought to be uncertainties of the estimated conductances and forcing data errors. The central concepts and processes related to new models are described via plots of temperature versus specific humidity to explore the theory behind an ET model. Through these efforts, we anticipate making more reliable ET predictions that will lead to a complete understanding of vegetation–atmosphere interactions.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Environmental models are sensitive to inaccuracies in their approximation algorithms, which can bias model simulations and even lead to incorrect concepts.

Through these efforts, we anticipate making more reliable ET predictions that will lead to a complete understanding of vegetation–atmosphere interactions.&lt;/p>;</content:encoded><dc:creator> Guoxiao Wei, Zijing Zhao, Wei Tian, Zhongqi Qiu, Zewei Yang, Fubing Wang</dc:creator><category> Research Article</category><dc:title> Two Alternatives to the Two‐Source Energy Balance Evapotranspiration Model</dc:title><dc:identifier> 10.1029/2022WR032958</dc:identifier><prism:publicationname> Water Resources Research</prism:publicationname><prism:doi> 10.1029/2022WR032958</prism:doi><prism:url> https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022WR032958?af=R</prism:url><prism:section> Research Article</prism:section><prism:volume> 59</prism:volume><prism:number> 3个</prism:number></item><item><link/>https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022WR033026?af=R<pubDate> Tue, 07 Mar 2023 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate><dc:date> 2023-03-07T12:00:00-08:00</dc:date><source url="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/19447973?af=R"/> Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents<prism:coverdate> Wed, 01 Mar 2023 00:00:00 -0800</prism:coverdate><prism:coverdisplaydate> Wed, 01 Mar 2023 00:00:00 -0800</prism:coverdisplaydate><guid ispermalink="false"> 10.1029/2022WR033026</guid><title> Toward Improved Parameterizations of Reservoir Operation in Ungauged Basins: A Synergistic Framework Coupling Satellite Remote Sensing, Hydrologic Modeling, and Conceptual Operation Schemes</title><description> Water Resources Research, Volume 59, Issue 3, March 2023.</description><dc:description> Abstract Assessments of water and energy security over historical and future periods require hydrologic models that can accurately simulate reservoir operations.

In traditional partial‐differential‐equation (pde)‐based models that treat aquifers as separate compartments, groundwater recharge needs to be defined as a boundary condition or it is a coupling condition to other compartments. Integrated models that treat the vadose and phreatic zones as a continuum allow for a more sophisticated calculation of subsurface fluxes, as feedbacks between both zones are captured. However, they do not contain an explicit groundwater‐recharge term so it needs to be estimated by post‐processing. Groundwater recharge consists of the flux crossing the water table, which can be calculated based on hydraulic gradients, and of changes in groundwater storage. We introduce a method to evaluate the change of groundwater storage by a time‐cumulative water balance over the depth section of water table fluctuations, avoiding the use of a specific yield. We demonstrate the approach first by a simple 1‐D vertical model that does not allow for lateral outflow and illustrates the ambiguity of computing groundwater recharge by different methods. We then apply the approach to a 3‐D model with a complex topography and subsurface structure. The latter example shows that groundwater recharge is highly variable in space and time with notable differences between regional and local estimates. Local heterogeneity of topography or subsurface properties results in complex redistribution patterns of groundwater. In fully integrated models, river‐groundwater exchange flow may severely bias the estimate of groundwater recharge. We therefore advice masking out groundwater recharge at river locations.

In particular, the variability in SM reached an unprecedented level after the 1950s relative to that during the past three centuries. A structural equation model and running correlation analysis revealed that SM variation was mainly controlled by precipitation rather than temperature.

High‐frequency monitoring of NO3− mass balance between upstream and downstream measurement sites can quantitatively disentangle multi‐path NO3− uptake dynamics at the reach scale. However, this approach remains limited to a few river types and has not been fully explored for higher‐order streams with varying hydro‐morphological and biogeochemical conditions. We conducted two‐station 15‐min monitoring in five high‐order stream reaches in central Germany, calculating the NO3−‐N mass balance and whole‐stream metabolism based on time series of NO3−‐N and dissolved oxygen, respectively. With thorough considerations of lateral inputs, the calculated net NO3−‐N uptake rates () differed substantially among campaigns (ranging from −151.1 to 357.6 mg N m2 d−1, with cases of negative values representing net NO3−‐N release), and exhibited higher during the post‐wet season than during the dry season. Subtracting autotrophic assimilation (, stoichiometrically coupled to stream metabolism) from , represented the net balance of heterotrophic NO3−‐N uptake ( >; 0, the dominance of denitrification and heterotrophic assimilation) and NO3−‐N release ( &lt; 0, the dominance of nitrification/mineralization). This rarely reported uptake pathway contributed substantially to patterns, especially during post‐wet seasons; moreover, it appeared to exhibit various diel patterns, and for >; 0, diel minima occurred during the daytime. These findings advance our understanding of complex reach‐scale N‐retention processes and can help develop future modeling concepts at the river‐network scale.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In-stream nitrate (NO&lt;sub>;3&lt;/sub>; &lt;sup>;−&lt;/sup>;) uptake in rivers involves complex autotrophic and heterotrophic pathways, which often vary spatiotemporally due to biotic and abiotic drivers.

With thorough considerations of lateral inputs, the calculated net NO&lt;sub>;3&lt;/sub>; &lt;sup>;−&lt;/sup>;-N uptake rates () differed substantially among campaigns (ranging from −151.1 to 357.6 mg N m&lt;sup>;2&lt;/sup>; d&lt;sup>;−1&lt;/sup>;, with cases of negative values representing net NO&lt;sub>;3&lt;/sub>; &lt;sup>;−&lt;/sup>;-N release), and exhibited higher during the post-wet season than during the dry season. Subtracting autotrophic assimilation (, stoichiometrically coupled to stream metabolism) from , represented the net balance of heterotrophic NO&lt;sub>;3&lt;/sub>; &lt;sup>;−&lt;/sup>;-N uptake ( &amp;gt; 0, the dominance of denitrification and heterotrophic assimilation) and NO&lt;sub>;3&lt;/sub>; &lt;sup>;−&lt;/sup>;-N release ( &amp;lt; 0, the dominance of nitrification/mineralization). This rarely reported uptake pathway contributed substantially to patterns, especially during post-wet seasons; moreover, it appeared to exhibit various diel patterns, and for &amp;gt; 0, diel minima occurred during the daytime. These findings advance our understanding of complex reach-scale N-retention processes and can help develop future modeling concepts at the river-network scale.&lt;/p>;</content:encoded><dc:creator> Xiaolin Zhang, Xiaoqiang Yang, Robert Hensley, Andreas Lorke, Michael Rode</dc:creator><category> Research Article</category><dc:title> Disentangling In‐Stream Nitrate Uptake Pathways Based on Two‐Station High‐Frequency Monitoring in High‐Order Streams</dc:title><dc:identifier> 10.1029/2022WR032329</dc:identifier><prism:publicationname> Water Resources Research</prism:publicationname><prism:doi> 10.1029/2022WR032329</prism:doi><prism:url> https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022WR032329?af=R</prism:url><prism:section> Research Article</prism:section><prism:volume> 59</prism:volume><prism:number> 3个</prism:number></item><item><link/>https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022WR033059?af=R<pubDate> Mon, 06 Mar 2023 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate><dc:date> 2023-03-06T12:00:00-08:00</dc:date><source url="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/19447973?af=R"/> Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents <prism:coverdate></prism:coverdate><prism:coverdisplaydate></prism:coverdisplaydate><guid ispermalink="false"> 10.1029/2022WR033059</guid><title> Under What Conditions Does Transverse Macrodispersion Exist in Groundwater Flow?</title><description> Water Resources Research, Accepted Article.</description><dc:description> Abstract In recent years there has been vigorous debate whether asymptotic transverse macrodispersion exists in steady three‐dimensional (3D) groundwater flows in the purely advective limit. This question is tied to the topology of 3D flow paths (termed the Lagrangian kinematics), specifically whether streamlines can undergo braiding motions or can wander freely in the transverse direction. In this study we determine which Darcy flows do admit asymptotic transverse macrodispersion for purely advective transport on the basis of the conductivity structure. We prove that porous media with smooth, locally isotropic hydraulic conductivity exhibit zero transverse macrodispersion under pure advection due to constraints on the Lagrangian kinematics of these flows, whereas either non‐smooth or locally anisotropic conductivity fields can generate transverse macrodispersion. This has implications for upscaling locally isotropic porous media to the block scale as this can result in a locally anisotropic conductivity, leading to non‐zero macrodispersion at the block scale that is spurious in that it does not arise for the fully resolved Darcy scale flow. We also show that conventional numerical methods for computation of particle trajectories do not explicitly preserve the kinematic constraints associated with locally isotropic Darcy flow, and propose a novel psuedo‐symplectic method that does preserve these constraints. These results provide insights into the mechanisms that govern transverse macrodispersion in groundwater flow, and unify seemingly contradictory results in the literature in a coherent framework. These insights call into question the ability of smooth, locally isotropic conductivity fields to represent flow and transport in real heterogeneous porous media.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In recent years there has been vigorous debate whether asymptotic transverse macrodispersion exists in steady three-dimensional (3D) groundwater flows in the purely advective limit.

Water managers need tools to quantify these impacts and predict future water temperatures. Contrary to most statistical models&#39; assumptions, many seasonally changing factors (eg, water sources and solar radiation) cause relationships between flow and water temperature to vary throughout the year. Using 21 yr of air temperature and flow data, we modeled daily water temperatures in California&#39;s snowmelt‐driven Scott River where agricultural diversions consume most summer surface flows. We used generalized additive models to test time‐varying and nonlinear effects of flow on water temperatures. Models that represented seasonally varying flow effects with intermediate complexity outperformed simpler models assuming constant relationships between water temperature and flow. Cross‐validation error of the selected model was ≤1.2°C. Flow variation had stronger effects on water temperatures in April–July than in other months. We applied the model to predict effects of instream flow scenarios proposed by regulatory agencies. Relative to historic conditions, the higher instream flow scenario would reduce annual maximum temperature from 25.2° to 24.1°C, reduce annual exceedances of 22°C (a cumulative thermal stress metric) from 106 to 51 degree‐days, and delay onset of water temperatures >;22°C during some drought years. Testing the same modeling approach at nine additional sites showed similar accuracy and flow effects. These methods can be applied to streams with long‐term flow and water temperature records to fill data gaps, identify periods of flow influence, and predict temperatures under flow management scenarios.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Low streamflows can increase vulnerability to warming, impacting coldwater fish.

The difficulties associated with accurately characterizing soil O2 variability have prompted the use of soil moisture as a proxy for O2, as O2 diffusion into soil water is much slower than in soil air. The use of soil moisture alone as a proxy measurement for O2 could result in inaccurate O2 estimations. For example, O2 may remain high during cool months when soil respiration rates are low. We analyzed high‐frequency sensor data (eg, soil moisture, CO2, gas‐phase soil pore O2) with a machine learning technique, the Self‐Organizing Map, to pinpoint suites of soil conditions associated with contrasting O2 regimes. At two riparian sites in northern Vermont, we found that O2 levels varied seasonally, and with soil moisture. For example, forty‐seven percent of low O2 levels were associated with wet and cool soil conditions, whereas 32% were associated with dry and warm conditions. Contrastingly, the majority (62%) of high O2 conditions occurred under dry and warm conditions. High soil moisture levels did not always lead to low O2, as 38% of high O2 values occurred under wet and cool conditions. Our results highlight challenges with predicting soil O2 solely based on water content, as variable combinations of soil and hydrologic conditions can complicate the relationship between water content and O2. This indicates that process‐based ecosystem and denitrification models that rely solely on soil moisture to estimate O2 may need to incorporate other site and climate‐specific drivers to accurately predict soil O2.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Oxygen (O&lt;sub>;2&lt;/sub>;) regulates soil reduction-oxidation processes and therefore modulates biogeochemical cycles.

Monsoon indices: the Indian Summer Monsoon Index (ISMI), East Asian Summer Monsoon Index (EASMI), South Asian Summer Monsoon Index (SASMI), and Western‐North Pacific Monsoon Index (WNPMI) have been studied to create a correlation, coherency, and teleconnection with the ISMR over the Mahanadi River basin (MRB) during 1948–2017. High‐resolution gridded precipitation data were employed to assess the statistical properties of the monsoon and to address the correlation, coherency, and teleconnection with the ISMR. Spearman&#39;s rank‐based correlation test, a non‐parametric Mann‐Kendall trend test, and Sen&#39;s slope have been used to assess the statistical properties of observed precipitation and the monsoon indices. Furthermore, wavelet transform coherence is used to detect transient correlations between ISMR and monsoon indices that have previously been uncorrelated. SASMI (ρ=0.440) dominates ISMI (ρ=0.422) as the most significant and influential long‐distance indicator with ISMR.

Passive microwave remote sensing is a powerful technique for monitoring this timing. We processed low‐frequency microwave time series from the European Space Agency Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission for a set of 31 satellite gauging reaches (SGRs) above 65°N between 2010 and 2020 to determine timing of freeze‐up and break‐up and annual river ice durations. We found indication of progressive ice cover reduction over more than half of the monitored river reaches, with possibly the fastest rate occurring over northeast Russia. Some rivers in high‐latitude North America experienced a slight increase in ice cover. Across the data set, we observed an average 2.2 days shift toward later ice freeze‐up in autumn and an average 0.6 days shift toward earlier ice break‐up in spring, resulting in an average decrease of 3.4 days in ice duration between 2010 and 2020. River reaches with the longest duration of ice cover appeared to have experienced the fastest rate of decrease. A possible reduction of the time lag between air temperature rise or fall and corresponding river ice break‐up and freeze‐up was also observed. Yet results on variability are carefuly interpreted given the short length of the time series (2010–2020) and the low statistical confidence rates calculated for the decadal tendency. Still outcomes are consistent with increases in global and Arctic surface air temperature. Following these time series over the next decade using passive microwave satellite sensors can monitor ice cover duration in the Arctic and will further determine temporal and regional trends.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The timing of ice freeze-up and break-up in the Arctic may be responding to climate change.

Less annual streamflow was generated from annual rainfall during the drought than would have been expected for the same rainfall before the drought. Changes in weather systems, such as cyclones, fronts, and thunderstorms, were also observed during this period. In this study, we assess the role that changes in weather systems played in the RRR shift. We find that catchments that experienced a RRR shift tended to receive less of their rainfall from frontal weather systems, and more of their rainfall from thunderstorm‐enhanced cyclone and cyclone‐front hybrid systems during the drought than catchments that showed little change in RRR. Overall, changes in the proportion of rainfall from weather systems alone explained up to 43% of the variance in the RRR shift between catchments. Including parameters that quantify catchment processes and physiographic features indicated that weather system changes are not the primary indicator of a RRR shift. Catchment mean slope, aridity and valley confinement, together with proportional rainfall change of cyclone‐thunderstorms and cyclone‐front‐thunderstorms, explained 60% of the variance in the RRR shift between catchments. Focusing on streamflow availability, we find the importance of different weather systems and catchment characteristics varies depending on warm or cool season, eastern or western Victoria, and before or during the drought. Following the drought, some catchments largely maintained the RRR shift that occurred during the drought, and also experienced less of their rainfall from fronts and cyclones compared to the other catchments.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Many Victorian catchments experienced a rainfall-runoff relationship (RRR) shift during the Millennium Drought (1997–2009).

Including parameters that quantify catchment processes and physiographic features indicated that weather system changes are not the primary indicator of a RRR shift. Catchment mean slope, aridity and valley confinement, together with proportional rainfall change of cyclone-thunderstorms and cyclone-front-thunderstorms, explained 60% of the variance in the RRR shift between catchments. Focusing on streamflow availability, we find the importance of different weather systems and catchment characteristics varies depending on warm or cool season, eastern or western Victoria, and before or during the drought. Following the drought, some catchments largely maintained the RRR shift that occurred during the drought, and also experienced less of their rainfall from fronts and cyclones compared to the other catchments.&lt;/p>;</content:encoded><dc:creator> Peter Rensch, Margot Turner, Margarita Saft, Murray C.

Metrics characterizing event runoff coefficient, event timescale and normalized peak discharge and their mean, variability and seasonality statistics are extracted to quantify event characteristics. Using random forest models, we find climate attributes are most influential in controlling the spatial pattern, with land cover, geology and soil properties also playing a critical role especially for explaining the variability of event runoff response. Rainfall characteristics (particularly rainfall depth) exhibit dominant controls on the temporal dynamic at event scale, while catchment initial state (antecedent soil moisture) determines its seasonal variations. Clear regional patterns of event characteristics are observed in Great Britain, while the influences of geology and anthropogenic activities on local differences are detected. Extremely low runoff coefficient values (&lt;0.05) but with high variability are typical in Chalk catchments in Southeast region. Flashy events with short event timescale (&lt;10 hr) and less seasonality of runoff response are observed in urban catchments. A large reservoir close to a gauge leads to the reduction of peak flows, yet the deviation is relatively small in summer. The impact of surface water abstractions is not obvious in our data set, whereas the impact of groundwater abstractions largely reflects the geology. This study provides the basis for regionalization studies by revealing the (dis)similarities of catchment runoff response and emphasizes the need for further research into the role of geology and human activities on rainfall‐runoff characteristics.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;This study reveals the spatiotemporal variability of event characteristics and their controls from 290,743 rainfall-runoff events across 431 Great Britain catchments.

However, information on WRT is often missing or outdated, especially in regions lacking lake inflow or outflow observations. Recent advances in global precipitation and evapotranspiration (ET) products and calibration‐free ET models provide the possibility of estimating lake WRT at large scales using estimated runoff from the water balance over the lake catchment. Here, we tested four global ET products and two calibration‐free ET models for estimating the mean annual lake outflow and WRT of 67 globally distributed lakes using precipitation inputs from four global precipitation products. The results show that the WRT estimated using the water balance method and global ET estimates generally correlates well with reference WRT (R = 0.90 ∼ 0.99) when using reliable precipitation inputs and is slightly more accurate than the estimates from the existing global WRT dataset and methods (R = 0.79 ∼ 0.94). Despite the large relative error (RE) in the estimates of the WRT, the RE of the phosphorus retention derived from the estimated WRT is acceptable (RE &lt; ±30%). The simplicity and versatility of this approach underline its potential applications to large‐scale studies that require a fair estimation of WRT.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Water residence time (WRT) is an important lake attribute that influences almost all in-lake nutrient processes.

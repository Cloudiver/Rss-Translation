Our results demonstrate that bedload is indeed transported by the bore front and ceases soon after the arrival of most bores, even though water depth continues to rise. Bores arriving on a dry river bed usually generate higher bedload fluxes than bores advancing over flowing water. Elevated values of shear stress, turbulent kinetic energy and water-surface slope occur as a bore impinges but then decrease. This is likely to be the explanation for high transient rates of bedload transport. Once the threshold depth previously determined as inducing continuous bedload motion is attained (≈40 cm), transport rates rise considerably relative to those associated with the bores.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This article is protected by copyright.

Daily GWET, total evapotranspiration (ET), groundwater recharge, base flow, and total runoff are simulated by the Integrated Hydrologic Model, which dynamically couples a surface water model (HSPF) and a groundwater flow model (MODFLOW). The roles of GWET on long‐term water balance are quantified by four ratios. The ratios of GWET to total available water, watershed wetting, ET, and recharge decrease exponentially with watershed aridity index, which is defined as the ratio of potential evapotranspiration to total available water. In the one‐stage precipitation partitioning framework, the contribution of GWET to the ratio between total ET and available water for ET (ie, the y‐axis of Budyko curve) decreases with watershed aridity index. In the two‐stage precipitation partitioning framework, the contribution of GWET to the ratio between total ET and watershed wetting (ie, Horton index) decreases with watershed aridity index. The changes in GWET caused by intra‐monthly climate variability are the highest among the temporal scales of climate variability investigated to understand controls on GWET. The inter‐annual, intra‐annual and intra‐monthly climate variabilities lead to increase of GWET; but the sub‐daily climate variability results in decrease of GWET.

Passive microwave remote sensing is a powerful technique for monitoring this timing. We processed low‐frequency microwave time series from the European Space Agency Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission for a set of 31 satellite gauging reaches (SGRs) above 65°N between 2010 and 2020 to determine timing of freeze‐up and break‐up and annual river ice durations. We found indication of progressive ice cover reduction over more than half of the monitored river reaches, with possibly the fastest rate occurring over northeast Russia. Some rivers in high‐latitude North America experienced a slight increase in ice cover. Across the data set, we observed an average 2.2 days shift towards later ice freeze‐up in autumn and an average 0.6 day shift towards earlier ice break‐up in spring, resulting in an average decrease of 3.4 days in ice duration between 2010 and 2020. River reaches with the longest duration of ice cover appeared to have experienced the fastest rate of decrease. A possible reduction of the time lag between air temperature rise or fall and corresponding river ice break‐up and freeze‐up was also observed. Yet results on variability are carefuly interpreted given the short length of the time series (2010‐2020) and the low statistical confidence rates calculated for the decadal tendency. Still outcomes are consistent with increases in global and Arctic surface air temperature. Following these time series over the next decade using passive microwave satellite sensors can monitor ice cover duration in the Arctic and will further determine temporal and regional trends.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The timing of ice freeze-up and break-up in the Arctic may be responding to climate change.

This study develops a latent factor‐based machine learning method to learn the pairwise association between the behavioral characteristics under climate forcing of a catchment and a hydrological model instance. The underlying assumption is that the behaviors of catchments and model instances can be sufficiently well characterized by sets of latent factors that allow accurate prediction of the associations between observed and modeled behaviors. In this study, the proposed method was applied to learn the latent factor vectors of 2,649 catchments worldwide and over 1,000,000 model instances from their pairwise associations (similarities between observed and simulated catchment behaviors). The model instances were created using 36 conceptual model structures or modeling software, and the their parameter values are randomly sampled. The results show that the learned latent factor vectors are able to accurately characterize the associations between catchments and hydrological model instances. The latent factor vector of a ”new” catchment (not seen by the training procedures) can be estimated by evaluating a small number of randomly sampled model instances, from which well‐fitting model instances created using different conceptual models can be recommended. The recommended instances can be of comparable quality to those derived using a calibration algorithm, and the method is useful for catchments outside the regions from which the latent factor vectors of the model instances were derived.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Hydrological models are simplified representations of catchments.

Additionally, some articles reveal potential drawbacks reducing benefits provided specifically by street trees and riparian woodland. Leaf litter falling on impervious surfaces can heighten risk of TP leaching to streams, but has little impact on TN. Riparian woodland was found to have complex water quality impacts.

We consider a total of 81 stations at 10 min resolution in Switzerland. Due to the marked seasonality of rainfall in the study area, we performed a seasonal-based analysis. The results reveal the model based on the data-driven approach as the best model. It is able to correctly model the observed intensities across duration while being reliable and robust. It is also able to reproduce the space and time variability of extreme rainfall across Switzerland.&lt;/p>;</content:encoded><dc:creator> Abubakar Haruna, Juliette Blanchet, Anne‐Catherine Favre</dc:creator><category> Research Article</category><dc:title> Modeling Intensity‐Duration‐Frequency curves for the whole range of non‐zero precipitation: A comparison of models</dc:title><dc:identifier> 10.1029/2022WR033362</dc:identifier><prism:publicationname> Water Resources Research</prism:publicationname><prism:doi> 10.1029/2022WR033362</prism:doi><prism:url> https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022WR033362?af=R</prism:url><prism:section> Research Article</prism:section></item><item><link/> https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022WR033061?af=R<pubDate> Sun, 07 May 2023 23:55:12 -0700</pubDate><dc:date> 2023-05-07T11:55:12-07:00</dc:date><source url="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/19447973?af=R"/> Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents <prism:coverdate></prism:coverdate><prism:coverdisplaydate></prism:coverdisplaydate><guid ispermalink="false"> 10.1029/2022WR033061</guid><title> The role of atmospheric rivers on groundwater: Lessons learned from an extreme wet year</title><description> Water Resources Research, Accepted Article.</description><dc:description> Abstract In the coastal regions of the western United States, atmospheric rivers (ARs) are associated with the largest precipitation generating storms and contribute up to half of annual precipitation, but the impact of ARs on the integrated hydrologic cycle, specifically on groundwater storage and hydrodynamics, is largely unknown.

Despite ARs contributing more precipitation than non‐AR storms, we find less AR water is preferentially stored in aquifers by year end. Fractionally, ARs result in 300% less snow derived groundwater‐recharged compared to non‐AR precipitation. Rain‐on‐snow plays an important role in AR‐driven discharge, where over 50% of total discharge from ARs snow is from rain‐on‐snow events. Finally, despite record‐breaking annual precipitation, simulated groundwater depletion occurs by year end due to estimates of groundwater pumping activities. The results from these simulations serve as a partial analogue of future hydrologic conditions where ARs are expected to intensify and provide a greater fraction of annual precipitation due to climate change.

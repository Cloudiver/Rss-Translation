Column mass balance models reproduced the observed PFOS and PFOA profiles, providing an estimate of historical effluent PFOS and PFOA concentrations: 70–170 ng L−1 and 1,000–1,300 ng L−1, respectively. Estimated concentrations were comparable to measurements in other wastewater effluents in the 1990s and 2000s, indicating that wastewater‐irrigated soils can serve as integrated records of historical PFAA loading to the environment. Mass balance calculations suggest that PFOS breakthrough to groundwater occurred 50 years after the start of wastewater irrigation, whereas simulated PFOA breakthrough occurred after only 10 years of irrigation. While wastewater irrigation of soils facilitates retention and reduces effluent PFAA loading to surface waters, resulting PFAA storage in soils potentially creates long‐term sources of PFAAs to groundwater.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs), a group of synthetic compounds associated with adverse human health impacts, are commonly found in effluent discharged from wastewater treatment facilities. When that effluent is used for irrigation, the fate of PFAAs depends strongly on soil PFAA retention properties and effluent PFAA loading history. The relative importance of PFAA retention factors under natural field-scale conditions remains uncertain, and the historical record of effluent PFAA concentrations is limited. Using soil cores collected from the Penn State Living Filter (irrigated with treated wastewater effluent for nearly 60 years), we evaluated PFAA mass balance in the irrigated soils and estimated historical effluent PFAA concentrations.

As surface waters contract through dry periods, reconnect during storms, and re‐expand or dry again, there is a great deal of variability in carbon emissions and export. We measured discharge, dissolved oxygen, carbon dioxide (CO2), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) continuously in a persistent pool at the base of a non‐perennial, forested headwater stream in the southeastern United States to characterize how flow changes affect carbon emissions and export as the stream expands and shrinks. We also compared carbon concentrations and export during different stream flow categories before and after fall wet‐up. CO2 concentrations were high when discharge was lowest (median = 10.2 mg L−1) and low during high flows (3.2 mg L−1) and storms (1.1 mg L−1). High CO2 concentrations led to high emissions on a per area basis during low flow times, but whole‐channel stream CO2 emissions were limited by the small surface area of the stream during periods of surface water disconnection. DOC concentration varied by season (range = 0.1–16.2 mg L−1) with large pulses during smaller summer storms. We found that CO2 and DOC concentrations differed among binned stages of stream flow. As non‐perennial streams become more prevalent across the southeastern United States due to shifts in climate, the relationships between flow and carbon movement into and out of stream networks will become increasingly critical to understanding stream carbon biogeochemistry.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Non-perennial headwaters experience extremes in flow conditions that likely influence carbon fate.

We examined how watershed topography and streambed hydraulic conductivity impact groundwater age and stream discharge at eight sites along a headwater stream within the Manitou Experimental Forest, CO USA. To do so, we measured: (a) continuous stream and groundwater discharge/level and specific conductivity from April to November 2021; (b) biweekly stream and groundwater chemistry; (c) groundwater chlorofluorocarbons and tritium in spring and fall; (d) streambed hydraulic conductivity; and (e) local slope. We used the chemistry data to calculate fluorite saturation states that were used to inform end‐member mixing analysis of streamflow source. We then combined chlorofluorocarbon and tritium data to estimate the age composition of riparian groundwater. Our data suggest that future stream drying is more probable where local slope is steep and streambed hydraulic conductivity is high. In these areas, groundwater source shifted seasonally, as indicated by age increases, and we observed a high fraction of groundwater in streamflow, primarily interflow from adjacent hillslopes. In contrast, where local slope is flat and streambed hydraulic conductivity is low, streamflow is more likely to persist as groundwater age was seasonally constant and buffered by storage in alluvial sediments. Groundwater age and streamflow paired with characterization of watershed topography and subsurface characteristics enabled identification of likely controls on future stream drying patterns.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The western US is experiencing increasing rain to snow ratios due to climate change, and scientists are uncertain how changing recharge patterns will affect future groundwater-surface water connection.

The difficulty of capturing these constraints across many basins in a generalized framework has limited the accuracy of streamflow estimates in land‐surface models for locations downstream of reservoirs. We develop a Piecewise Linear Regression Tree to learn generalized daily operating policies from 76 reservoirs from four major basins across the coterminous US. Reservoir characteristics, such as residence time and maximum storage, and daily state variables, such as storage and inflow, are used to group similar observations across all reservoirs. Linear regression equations are then fit between daily state variables and release for each group. We recommend two models—Model 1 (M1) that performs the best when simulating untrained records but is complex and Model 2 (M2) that is nearly as performant as M1 but more parsimonious.

The difficulty of capturing these constraints across many basins in a generalized framework has limited the accuracy of streamflow estimates in land-surface models for locations downstream of reservoirs. We develop a Piecewise Linear Regression Tree to learn generalized daily operating policies from 76 reservoirs from four major basins across the coterminous US. Reservoir characteristics, such as residence time and maximum storage, and daily state variables, such as storage and inflow, are used to group similar observations across all reservoirs. Linear regression equations are then fit between daily state variables and release for each group. We recommend two models—Model 1 (M1) that performs the best when simulating untrained records but is complex and Model 2 (M2) that is nearly as performant as M1 but more parsimonious.

This study examined changes in the transport of phosphorus (P) in an agricultural drainage ditch in the Maumee River Basin (Ohio, USA) by conducting constant rate injections of a novel tracer mixture (conservative salt [Cl as NaCl], dissolved P [KH2PO4], and a fluorescent fine particle) in spring, summer, and fall.

The impact of mineral dissolution on flow characteristics depends on the connectivity and tortuosity of the pore network. Persistent homology is a tool from algebraic topology that describes the size and connectivity of topological features. When applied to 3D X‐ray computed tomography (XCT) imagery of rock cores, it provides a novel metric of pore network heterogeneity. Prior works have demonstrated the efficacy of persistent homology in predicting flow properties in numerical simulations of flow through porous media.

In this study, three limestone cores were imaged by XCT before and after acid‐driven dissolution flow‐through experiments. Each XCT scan was analyzed using persistent homology. In all three rocks, permeability increase was driven by the growth of large, connected pore bodies. The two most homogenous samples saw an increased effect nearer to the flow inlet, suggesting emerging preferential flow paths as the reaction front progresses. The most heterogeneous sample showed an increase in along‐core homogeneity during reaction. Variability of persistence showed moderate positive correlation with pore body size increase.

Decomposing and quantifying the effects of climate on discharge allows us to understand their impact on water resources better. We propose a methodology to separate the effect of change in the annual mean of climate variables from the effect of the intra‐annual distribution of precipitation. It combines the Budyko framework with Land Surface Model (LSM) outputs. The LSM is used to reproduce the behavior of 2134 reconstructed watersheds across Europe between 1902 and 2010, with climate inputs as the only source of change. We fit a one‐parameter approximation of the Budyko framework to the LSM outputs. It accounts for the evolution of the annual mean in precipitation (P) and potential evapotranspiration (PET). We introduce a varying parameter in the equation, representing the effect of long‐term variations in the intra‐annual distribution of P and PET. To better assess the effects of changes in annual means or intra‐annual distribution of P, we construct synthetic forcings fixing one or the other. European results show that the trends in the annual averages of P dominate the trends in discharge due to climate. The second main climate driver is PET, except over the Mediterranean area, where changes in intra‐annual variations of P have a higher impact on discharge than trends in PET. Therefore the effects of changes in the intra‐annual distribution of climate variables are to be addressed when looking at changes in annual discharge.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In the context of climate change, the stakes surrounding water availability are rapidly intensifying.

The impact of oil viscosity was investigated over a large range of fluid viscosity ratios. The results indicate that highly heterogeneous flow fields are generated by a wide distribution of oil clusters with varied volumes. Variation in the velocity distribution enhanced the deformation and spreading of a tracer plume, resulting in large dispersion scales and accelerated spreading rates. The dispersion coefficients vary with time and exhibit a non‐Fickian dispersion during co‐injection. Consequently, anomalous mixing behaviors can be observed when the viscosity ratio exceeds 10. The mixing strength, characterized by the scalar dissipation rate, is first enhanced by distortion on the surface of the solute. Therefore, diffusion contributes to mixing, resulting in a faster decrease in the mixing strength in the late time regime. These results can be attributed to the fact that the non‐wetting fluid becomes disconnected, and the size of each cluster decreases as the oil viscosity increases. The formation of an oil film narrows pore spaces, and a lubrication effect of the oil film may contribute to the enhanced dispersion and mixing state, even with the low relative permeability of the wetting phase. This study provides insights into dispersion in partially saturated porous media with varied oil viscosities at both the macro and pore scales, which can further improve CO2 storage capacity and safety.

This study provides insights into dispersion in partially saturated porous media with varied oil viscosities at both the macro and pore scales, which can further improve CO&lt;sub>;2&lt;/sub>; storage capacity and safety.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This article is protected by copyright.

This study leverages cross‐site empirical and theoretical analyses and develops a similarity index, based on the interactions amongst critical zone attributes, to determine the poorly‐studied influence of upland hillslope groundwater subsidy on storage‐discharge relation. We show that an increase in the relative extent of upland hillslope groundwater subsidy to low‐flow discharge, occurring through deep slow low‐moving (eg, bedrock) storage‐unit, leads to 1) an increase in the nonlinearity of low‐flow discharge sensitivity to storage (β1), and 2) an increase in the convexity of low‐flow storage‐discharge relation. Our findings also raise new hypotheses on the applicability of Boussinesq‐based hydraulic groundwater theory at low‐flow condition. Empirical results show that in a portion of our study catchments, particularly in those with a relatively small extent of upland hillslope groundwater subsidy, the theory&#39;s proposed range of nonlinearity sufficiently explains the nonlinearity of low‐flow storage‐discharge relation. However, in catchments with a strong influence of upland hillslope groundwater subsidy through deep slow‐moving storage‐unit the current state of hydraulic groundwater theory, using one single (non) linear representative storage‐unit, may not be sufficient to explain the large nonlinearity and convexity of low‐flow storage‐discharge relation (or the long tail of late‐recession). As β1 informs the low‐flow vulnerability of catchments, this study&#39;s findings deepen and generalize our understanding of where low‐flow discharge is vulnerable to storage&#39;s change.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Large-scale cross-site scientific synthesis on low-flow storage-discharge relation can promote developing transferable hypotheses on the interactions amongst critical zone attributes, and on how such interactions affect catchments&#39; water vulnerabilities.

The measurement of regional CWF requires large amounts of ground data, and remote sensing provides an effective means to scientifically measure the CWF on a large scale. In this study, we developed an effective means to estimate regional maize crop water footprint based on global evapotranspiration (MOD16 and GLDAS-Noah) products in China. And we also calculated the CWF based on the FAO Penman-Monteith equation (FAO-PM) on the site scale in China. We assessed the accuracy of these methods by comparing them against eight eddy-covariance based flux tower measurements. Links and differences behind the results of the three water footprint calculations were analyzed in terms of the basic principles and characteristics of the calculations.

To address this issue, we conduct 30 instantaneous tracer experiments in the Weierbach stream, Luxembourg.

Near‐stream groundwater monitoring wells and LIDAR scans of the streambed are used to evaluate the area of the hyporheic zone and of the submerged sediments for each experiment. Our findings show that increasing discharge enhances parameters interaction requiring more samples of TSM parameters to obtain identifiable results.

However, as discharge increases, in‐stream storage zones become part of the advective channel and the lower localized stream water losses to the adjacent groundwater suggests a decrease of the hyporheic exchange on transient storage. The results obtained were utilized to generate a hydrograph for the study site illustrating the dynamic evolution of in‐stream and hyporheic storage with varying discharge, providing insights into the expected influence of different transient storage processes prior to tracer experiments.

This study investigates model calibration using estimated signatures in an Approximate Bayesian Computation framework.

It governs the hydrologic and mechanical behaviors associated with freezing soil. Numerous studies have investigated the mechanisms of soil water freezing and attempted to predict SFCC using soil water characteristic curve (SWCC) and Clapeyron equation. However, limited attention has been given to the physical disparities between adsorbed and capillary water during freezing, including variations in pressures and water‐ice interfaces. In this study, we present a novel theoretical model for predicting SFCC.

It governs the hydrologic and mechanical behaviors associated with freezing soil. Numerous studies have investigated the mechanisms of soil water freezing and attempted to predict SFCC using soil water characteristic curve (SWCC) and Clapeyron equation. However, limited attention has been given to the physical disparities between adsorbed and capillary water during freezing, including variations in pressures and water-ice interfaces. In this study, we present a novel theoretical model for predicting SFCC. The model determines the freezing point by calculating the chemical potential of soil water and ice with their respective pressures, thus capturing the distinctions in freezing behaviors between adsorbed and capillary water. All model parameters possess clear physical interpretations, and the model solely relies on the SWCC as input.

However, the fluid flow behavior in porous materials with both complex pore structures and non‐uniform wettability are still unclear. Here, we performed unsteady‐state quasi‐static oil‐ and water‐flooding experiments to study multiphase flow in two sister heterogeneous sandstones with variable wettability conditions (ie, one natively water‐wet and one chemically treated to be mixed‐wet). The pore‐scale fluid distributions during this process were imaged by laboratory‐based X‐ray micro‐computed tomography (micro‐CT). In the mixed‐wet case, we observed pore filling events where the fluid interface appeared to be at quasi‐equilibrium at every position along the pore body (13% by volume), in contrast to capillary instabilities typically associated with slow drainage or imbibition. These events corresponded to slow displacements previously observed in unsteady‐state experiments, explaining the wide range of displacement time scales in mixed‐wet samples. Our new data allowed us to quantify the fluid saturations below the image resolution, indicating that slow events were caused by the presence of microporosity and the wetting heterogeneity. Finally, we investigated the sensitivity of the multi‐phase flow properties to the slow filling events using a state‐of‐the‐art multi‐scale pore network model. This indicated that pores where such events took place contributed up to 19% of the sample&#39;s total absolute permeability, but that the impact on the relative permeability may be smaller. Our study sheds new light on poorly understood multiphase fluid dynamics in complex rocks, of interest to for example, groundwater remediation and subsurface CO2 storage.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The wetting properties of pore walls have a strong effect on multiphase flow through porous media.

The Gulf of Alaska (GoA) region is an embodiment of this change, particularly concerning a shifting hydrologic balance. Even so, the magnitude and contribution of fresh submarine groundwater discharge (fresh SGD) remains virtually unexplored within the region, though it has gained increasing attention globally due to its chemical significance and influence on coastal ecosystems. Here we provide the first regional estimates of fresh SGD to the GoA using two established water balance approaches. This is an effective way to distinguish the contribution of terrestrially derived fresh SGD, rather than the more commonly quantified total SGD which includes discharge that is driven by marine forces such as sea‐level oscillations and density gradients. We compare the approaches and assess their capabilities in computing the magnitude of fresh SGD over a large regional scale. Mean annual fresh SGD flux ranges between 26.5 to 86.8 km3 yr‐1 to the GoA, equivalent to 3.5‐11.4% of the total freshwater discharge. Contributions are highest in the Southeastern panhandle and lowest in the Cook Inlet basin, with the highest area normalized contribution occurring in the Prince William Sound. Fresh SGD exhibits high spatial and temporal variability throughout the region. Although freshwater discharge to the GoA is investigated considerably, the importance of fresh SGD has, thus far, been overlooked.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;High latitude mountain environments are experiencing disproportionately adverse effects from climate change.

Here, we introduce a new framework for assessing water availability in 708 Brazilian catchments that considers the effect of CO2 concentrations on potential evapotranspiration, uses CMIP6 bias‐corrected climate change simulations, and presumes an open water balance assumption, while considering the human‐aspect by incorporating water demand projections. We note an average reduction of water security in 81% of the analyzed catchments by 2100. Among these catchments, 37% presented a reduction of future water availability, while 63% undergo a worse scenario due to an increase in human water use, which highlights the role of the human aspect in water security assessment.

However, it is unclear that how and to what extent the discharge fluctuations influence the delta morphology. In this study, we focus on the morphological response of the Yellow River Delta to the Water‐Sediment Regulation Schemes, which generate impulsive floods and deliver high sediment load within a short time. Tracking the fate of fluvial sediment released by 10 historical events reveals that 51.3%, 19.7%, and 17.8% of fluvial sediment are deposited in the delta front, the subaerial delta and the prodelta, respectively. Hypopycnal and hyperpycnal flows occur alternately during different phases of the regulation schemes, and the latter contribute to 32% of the deposition volume with 10% of the duration. To explore the effects of river discharge schematizations on delta evolution, numerical experiments are conducted to compare models forced by unsteady and constant discharges, with the latter being a common practice in delta morphology modeling. We show that the constant‐discharge simplification fails to capture the highly‐depositional hyperpycnal flows, leading to dramatic underestimation of river mouth depositions. In addition, we demonstrate that including the 3D flow‐sediment interactions are critical in reproducing the correct plume structures, bed surface sediment compositions and deposition patterns. Our study highlights the importance of proper river discharge schematizations and full consideration of flow‐sediment interactions in modeling deltas affected by episodic river floods and high suspended sediment concentrations.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Morphological evolution of river deltas depends to a large extent on river discharges, which are usually highly unsteady due to natural hydrological cycles and anthropogenic regulations.

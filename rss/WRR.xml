Even with the limited available monitoring stations, only a few of them monitor both stage and discharge data. But when there is a need for estimation of discharges at a gauging station, where only stage data is monitored, one may employ a reverse routing technique using the stage data monitored at a nearby downstream gauging station. This study develops a novel single‐parameter reverse‐stage routing (RSR) model based on the second‐order approximate water surface gradient governing equation to estimate stage and discharge at any scantily‐gauged upstream river section using the known stage information available at the downstream section. A novel criterion is also developed for checking the applicability of the RSR model. Reverse routing experiments, carried out by the RSR model using different hypothetical downstream stage hydrographs in a number of hypothetical trapezoidal and rectangular channel reaches to reproduce the benchmark upstream stage and discharge hydrographs, demonstrate the good performance of the RSR model with the Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency >;98%, absolute volume conservation error &lt;1.5%, and an absolute error in peak ≤1%. Subsequently, the RSR model was tested for three real‐river case studies in India and Italy with good reproduction performances, and along with the development of the corresponding normal rating curves at the upstream river sections.

Theoretically, regional cooperative agreements promise improved resource efficiency by realizing economies of scale, adding flexibility for achieving improved supply reliability, and, ideally, limiting individual and collective financial risks.

While water managers have explored a portfolio of options to reduce this stress, supply augmentation through reuse of treated municipal wastewater is becoming increasingly attractive. Wastewater treatment plants protect water quality and prevent sewage from contaminating waterways. Increasingly, this resource is utilized for numerous human (eg, irrigation, drinking water, groundwater recharge) and conservation (eg, stream and river recharge) needs in water stressed regions. To understand the role treated municipal wastewater plays in impacting conservation objectives we identified the intersection of wastewater treatment plant locations and occurrences of threatened and endangered (T&amp;E) species in California and compared the permitted contribution of effluent to baseflow quantities of the receiving waterbody to assess the degree to which changes in effluent could affect instream waterbodies. We found a positive correlation between the presence of treatment plants and T&amp;E species in California watersheds—a quarter of species have 100% of their range in watersheds with at least one treatment plant. This correlation is greatest for species associated with terraces and riparian habitat, followed by aquatic emergent vegetation and habitat. One‐third of watersheds in our analysis can receive most of their cumulative watershed baseflow from effluent and are characterized by dense urbanization or agriculture. Our analysis demonstrates that the fates of T&amp;E species and effluent are interconnected in ways important for water policy, suggesting that species conservation goals should be considered when making decisions about effluent reuse.

Increasingly, this resource is utilized for numerous human (eg, irrigation, drinking water, groundwater recharge) and conservation (eg, stream and river recharge) needs in water stressed regions. To understand the role treated municipal wastewater plays in impacting conservation objectives we identified the intersection of wastewater treatment plant locations and occurrences of threatened and endangered (T&amp;E) species in California and compared the permitted contribution of effluent to baseflow quantities of the receiving waterbody to assess the degree to which changes in effluent could affect instream waterbodies. We found a positive correlation between the presence of treatment plants and T&amp;E species in California watersheds—a quarter of species have 100% of their range in watersheds with at least one treatment plant. This correlation is greatest for species associated with terraces and riparian habitat, followed by aquatic emergent vegetation and habitat. One-third of watersheds in our analysis can receive most of their cumulative watershed baseflow from effluent and are characterized by dense urbanization or agriculture. Our analysis demonstrates that the fates of T&amp;E species and effluent are interconnected in ways important for water policy, suggesting that species conservation goals should be considered when making decisions about effluent reuse.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This article is protected by copyright.

However, identifying the optimal location to place sensors is still an open challenge. Many approaches have been proposed in literature to solve this problem. Complex network theory‐based approaches (CNW) to sensor placement are simple, easy to implement, take less computational time even for large‐scale networks, and do not require calibrated hydraulic and water‐quality models. However, existing CNW methods perform well for only a subset of common objectives. Optimization‐based approaches offer better placement but are computationally costly and require detailed knowledge of the WDS. We proposed a new method, “EQ‐Water,” to identify the locations to place water quality sensors for continuous and intermittent WDS with variable demand patterns. EQ‐Water is based on complex network theory, but uses minimal additional hydraulic information. We validate the performance of EQ‐Water on four real networks: BWSN 1, BWSN 2, JPN, and D2B networks. We have compared the performance with a number of approaches from literature, including the popular TEVA‐SPOT tool. The comparison is based on the four objective functions, Z1–Z4, which are commonly used, and also on a weighted cumulative objective function. Our results indicate that EQ‐Water is among the top three methods for BWSN 1, JPN and D2B when using diverse weights for the objective functions, and it shows median performance for BWSN 2. We also observe consistently superior performance against other CNW, and it is competitive with simulation‐based approaches while taking lesser time and effort.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Water quality sensors are used to detect contamination in water distribution systems (WDSs) to help supply safe and quality drinking water to society.

This question necessarily arises when calibrating dual‐continuum hydrogeological models against on‐field data. One can assume that observation wells measure fracture water head, because matrix permeability is negligible compared to fracture permeability. Nevertheless, this reasoning is invalid for wells poorly‐connected to the fractures. Yet, the possibility of such a poor connection at given depths has never been implemented in a physics‐based manner when comparing matrix and fracture water heads simulated by dual‐continuum models to on‐field data. To fill this knowledge gap, a physically based, easy to calibrate, open‐source postprocessing tool, POWeR‐FADS (Program for Observation Well Representation in Fractured Aquifer Dual‐continuum Simulations), available at https://github.com/BJeannot1/POWeR-FADS, has been developed. It introduces as parameters well geometry and the altitude of lowest interception of the fractures by the well. From these, POWeR‐FADS nonintrusively postprocesses time series of matrix and fracture water heads at the well, as simulated by any planar, bidimensional dual‐continuum hydrogeological model, to calculate water exchanges involving the observation well and thus the evolution of water level in the well. Synthetic test cases show that POWeR‐FADS makes it possible to simulate peculiar behaviors that are similar to patterns actually observed by the authors in on‐site observation wells of a fractured porous aquifer, like “floors” in observed water levels, delayed but sharp rises at the beginning of recharge events, or inflexion points accelerating the drawdown velocity during the recession phase.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Do observation wells in fractured porous aquifers measure water head in the fracture network, water head in the matrix, or some combination of both?

Synthetic test cases show that POWeR-FADS makes it possible to simulate peculiar behaviors that are similar to patterns actually observed by the authors in on-site observation wells of a fractured porous aquifer, like “floors” in observed water levels, delayed but sharp rises at the beginning of recharge events, or inflexion points accelerating the drawdown velocity during the recession phase.&lt;/p>;</content:encoded><dc:creator> B.

However, its application sometimes requires significant computational effort and presents reliability challenges. The Green and Ampt (G&amp;A) approach represents a conservative and efficient method to calculate one‐dimensional infiltration but is limited to deep, well drained, uniform, non‐layered soils for a single rainfall event. The original G&amp;A model and subsequent advancements represent wetting fronts as discrete objects, rather than discretizing the model domain in space, yielding a computationally simpler model than the RE. This paper describes an extension of the G&amp;A method into layered soils on a continuous basis that we call Layered Green and Ampt with Redistribution (LGAR). Assumptions employed in the derivation include: uniform soil hydraulic properties within layers, single‐valued capillary head at the interface between soil layers, and no influence of groundwater table on soil moisture. Wetting fronts advance due to the combined effects of gravity and wetting front capillary drive in a layered soil profile. Results of multi‐month continuous LGAR simulations of infiltration using forcing and soil hydraulic data from USDA SCAN sites are compared against infiltration calculated using the HYDRUS‐1D RE solver using standard metrics. The assumptions employed in deriving the LGAR method limit its application to situations where cumulative potential evapotranspiration is greater than cumulative precipitation, typical of arid or semi‐arid conditions. LGAR is a mass‐conservative, computationally efficient, reliable and reasonably accurate method for simulating infiltration over extended time periods compared to the numerical solution of the RE in layered soils in arid and semi‐arid regions.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Numerical solution of the one-dimensional Richards equation (RE) accurately partitions precipitation into infiltration and runoff in capillary dominated soils.

Despite the emphasis in the literature on the most severe hydrological responses to wildfire, there remains a knowledge gap on the thresholds of wildfire (ie burned area/drainage area ratio, BAR) required to initiate hydrological responses. We investigated hydrological changes in the Russian River Watershed (RRW) in California, a coastal, Mediterranean, drought‐prone, wildfire‐adapted ecosystem, following ten wildfires that burned 30% of the watershed. Our findings suggest that sub‐watersheds of the RRW have not burned beyond an intrinsic, unknown, threshold required to initiate change. Using paired watersheds, we examined spatiotemporal patterns of pre‐and‐post wildfire hydrology with a rainfall‐runoff hydrological model. Even though these successive wildfires burned 1‐50% of each sub‐watershed (1‐30% at moderate/high severity), we found little evidence of wildfire‐related shifts in hydrology. As a function of BAR, wildfire imposed limited effects on runoff ratios (runoff/precipitation) and runoff residuals (observations ‐ model simulations). Our findings that post‐wildfire runoff enhancements asymptote beyond 30% burn indicate that when a watershed is burned beyond a certain threshold, the magnitude of the hydrologic response no longer increases. Drought and storm conditions explained much of the variability observed in streamflow, whereas wildfire explained only moderate variability in streamflow even when wildfire accounted for >;45% BAR. While the BAR in the RRW was sufficiently beyond previously reported minimum disturbance thresholds (>;20% burned forest), the lack of hydrological response is attributed to buffering effects of wildfire adaptation and drought factors that are unique to Mediterranean ecoregions.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Wildfires naturally occur in many landscapes, however they are undergoing rapid regime shifts.

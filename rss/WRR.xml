To address this issue, ice segregation theory was used to analyze the physical meaning of the impedance factor. Based on assumptions sourced from segregation theory, experimental evidence regarding the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soil and the Gibbs-Thompson effect, a relationship between the impedance factor and soil parameters was deduced. The necessity of the impedance factor was discussed under closed unsaturated and open saturated freezing systems. Finally, the derived impedance factor was compared with the current empirical impedance factor. The results showed the following: (a) The impact of the impedance factor on closed unsaturated freezing systems was small. However, an impedance factor was necessary for water migration in freezing systems with a high degree of ice segregation, such as open saturated freezing systems.

Here, we investigate the evolutionary pattern of SM and then carry out an attribution analysis from climate and human perspectives. The results reveal an unbalanced surface and rootzone variation trend during 1980–2020. The surface soil had approximately equal proportions of drying and wetting. Nonetheless, the percentage of the wetting region is significantly higher than that of the drying region for rootzone soil. The significantly drying region is mainly distributed in habitable areas, while the remarkably wetting region is usually located in the harsh climate and tropical humid zones. According to the attribution analysis using the Feature Importance Index of the Random Forest model, Pearson correlation coefficient, Maximum information coefficient, Spearman rank correlation coefficient and Granger causality with 99% statistical significance, both climatic and human factors presented significant impacts on SM. Specifically, air temperature and evaporation are thought to be the primary climatic factors affecting the seasonal and long‐term variability of SM, respectively. Irrigation water withdrawal is regarded as the dominant driving force of SM variation among six human water withdrawals, and domestic and electricity water withdrawals play indispensable roles in SM fluctuation.

Here, we investigate the evolutionary pattern of SM and then carry out an attribution analysis from climate and human perspectives. The results reveal an unbalanced surface and rootzone variation trend during 1980–2020. The surface soil had approximately equal proportions of drying and wetting. Nonetheless, the percentage of the wetting region is significantly higher than that of the drying region for rootzone soil. The significantly drying region is mainly distributed in habitable areas, while the remarkably wetting region is usually located in the harsh climate and tropical humid zones. According to the attribution analysis using the Feature Importance Index of the Random Forest model, Pearson correlation coefficient, Maximum information coefficient, Spearman rank correlation coefficient and Granger causality with 99% statistical significance, both climatic and human factors presented significant impacts on SM. Specifically, air temperature and evaporation are thought to be the primary climatic factors affecting the seasonal and long-term variability of SM, respectively. Irrigation water withdrawal is regarded as the dominant driving force of SM variation among six human water withdrawals, and domestic and electricity water withdrawals play indispensable roles in SM fluctuation. Additionally, SM also provides profound feedbacks on climatic factors and human water withdrawals. The global spatial-temporal SM variation along with warming temperatures could seriously risk food security and sustainable development, which needs to be addressed.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This article is protected by copyright.

ET is challenging to quantify because of the uncertainties associated with the many ET equations currently in use, and because observations of ET are uncertain and sparse. In this study, we combine information provided by available ET data and equations to produce a new monthly data set for ET for the conterminous US (CONUS). These maps are produced from 1895‐2018 at an 800 m spatial scale, marking a finer resolution than currently available products over this time period.

The relative weights are spatially generalized using a random forest regression, which is applied to wall‐to‐wall explanatory variable maps to generate CONUS‐wide relative weight maps and ensemble estimates. We assess the performance of the ensemble using a reserved subset of the observations and compare this performance against other national‐scale map products for historical to modern ET. The ensemble ET maps are shown to provide an improved accuracy over the alternative comparison products.

The present study uses intrinsic diurnal fluctuations of electrical conductivity caused by discharge of treated wastewater as a tracer to evaluate solute transport processes along a 4.7‐km reach of the River Erpe, Germany. By reproducing the fluctuations recorded along the river using the solute transport model OTIS, this study investigated the long‐term dynamics in solute transport properties.

However, fluctuations in multiphase flow are currently not represented in continuum scale models, and their impact at the REV‐scale is unknown. Previous pore‐scale imaging studies on these fluctuations were limited to small samples with mm‐scale diameters and volumes on the order of ∼0.5 cm3. Here, we image steady‐state co‐injection experiments on a one‐inch diameter core plug sample, with nearly two orders of magnitude larger volume (21 cm3), while maintaining a pore‐scale resolution with X‐ray micro‐computed tomography. This was done for three total flow rates in a series of drainage fractional flow steps. Our observations differ markedly from those reported for mm‐scale samples in two ways: the macroscopic fluid distribution was less ramified at low capillary numbers (Ca) of 10−7; and the volume fraction of intermittency initially increased with increasing Ca (similar to mm‐scale observations), but then decreased at Ca of 10−7. Our results suggest that viscous forces may play a role in the cm‐scale fluid distribution, even at such low Ca, dampening intermittent pathway flow. A representative elementary volume study of the fluid saturation showed that this may be missed in smaller‐scale samples. Pressure drop measurements suggest that the observed pore‐scale fluctuations resulted in non‐Darcy like upscaled behavior. Overall, we show the usefulness of large field‐of‐view, high‐resolution imaging to bridge the gap between pore‐ and continuum‐scale multiphase flow studies.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Representative elementary volumes (REVs) are an important concept in studying subsurface multiphase flow at the continuum scale.

Overall, we show the usefulness of large field-of-view, high-resolution imaging to bridge the gap between pore- and continuum-scale multiphase flow studies.&lt;/p>;</content:encoded><dc:creator> Shan Wang, Catherine Spurin, Tom Bultreys</dc:creator><category> Research Article</category><dc:title> Pore‐Scale Imaging of Multiphase Flow Fluctuations in Continuum‐Scale Samples</dc:title><dc:identifier> 10.1029/2023WR034720</dc:identifier><prism:publicationname> Water Resources Research</prism:publicationname><prism:doi> 10.1029/2023WR034720</prism:doi><prism:url> https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR034720?af=R</prism:url><prism:section> Research Article</prism:section><prism:volume> 59</prism:volume><prism:number> 6个</prism:number></item><item><link/>https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022WR033153?af=R<pubDate> Thu, 15 Jun 2023 04:29:42 -0700</pubDate><dc:date> 2023-06-15T04:29:42-07:00</dc:date><source url="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/19447973?af=R"/> Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents<prism:coverdate> Thu, 01 Jun 2023 00:00:00 -0700</prism:coverdate><prism:coverdisplaydate> Thu, 01 Jun 2023 00:00:00 -0700</prism:coverdisplaydate><guid ispermalink="false"> 10.1029/2022WR033153</guid><title> Quantifying Groundwater&#39;s Contribution to Regional Environmental‐Flows in Diverse Hydrologic Landscapes</title><description> Water Resources Research, Volume 59, Issue 6, June 2023.</description><dc:description> Abstract Increasing recognition of the importance of ecosystem services in water resources management has accelerated the development and application of environmental‐flows requirements for lotic ecosystems. However, most environmental‐flows management focuses on water infrastructure, such as dams or diversions, without explicitly taking groundwater into account and ignoring the importance of groundwater environmental flow contribution. In this study two methods for estimating groundwater environmental flow contributions are presented: (a) a groundwater‐centric method (based on the Sustainability Boundary Approach), which proposes that high levels of ecological protection are maintained if 90% of groundwater discharge is preserved, and (b) a surface water‐centric method (novel method), which quantifies groundwater environmental flow contributions from streamflow using region‐specific streamflow sensitivity metrics and local environmental‐flows policies. The two methods were tested in British Columbia, Canada, which has a diverse, complex, and highly coupled groundwater‐surface water system. The two methods gave comparable results in various hydro‐geoclimatic settings. Although British Columbia was used as a case study, this framework can be implemented across various spatial and temporal scales for different regions and globally, in data‐scarce, hydrologically complex landscapes. Application of these methods can aid in a robust and holistic assessment of environmental‐flows, taking into account the often‐missing groundwater component.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Increasing recognition of the importance of ecosystem services in water resources management has accelerated the development and application of environmental-flows requirements for lotic ecosystems.

The difficulties associated with accurately characterizing soil O2 variability have prompted the use of soil moisture as a proxy for O2, as O2 diffusion into soil water is much slower than in soil air. The use of soil moisture alone as a proxy measurement for O2 could result in inaccurate O2 estimations. For example, O2 may remain high during cool months when soil respiration rates are low. We analyzed high‐frequency sensor data (eg, soil moisture, CO2, gas‐phase soil pore O2) with a machine learning technique, the Self‐Organizing Map, to pinpoint suites of soil conditions associated with contrasting O2 regimes. At two riparian sites in northern Vermont, we found that O2 levels varied seasonally, and with soil moisture. For example, 47% of low O2 levels were associated with wet and cool soil conditions, whereas 32% were associated with dry and warm conditions. Contrastingly, the majority (62%) of high O2 conditions occurred under dry and warm conditions. High soil moisture levels did not always lead to low O2, as 38% of high O2 values occurred under wet and cool conditions. Our results highlight challenges with predicting soil O2 solely based on water content, as variable combinations of soil and hydrologic conditions can complicate the relationship between water content and O2. This indicates that process‐based ecosystem and denitrification models that rely solely on soil moisture to estimate O2 may need to incorporate other site and climate‐specific drivers to accurately predict soil O2.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Oxygen (O&lt;sub>;2&lt;/sub>;) regulates soil reduction-oxidation processes and therefore modulates biogeochemical cycles.

Then, the meteorological variables processed by the Relief algorithm and variance inflation factor (VIF) features are employed as inputs, the individual subsequences of secondary and preliminary decomposition as outputs to the bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU) and extreme learning machine (ELM) models. Random forests (RF) are introduced to nonlinear ensemble the individual predicted sub-models to obtain the final prediction results. The proposed model outperforms other models in various evaluation metrics. Meanwhile, due to the opaque nature of machine learning models, shapley is employed to assess the contribution of each selected meteorological variable to the long-term trend of runoff. The proposed model could serve as an essential reference for precise flood prediction and timely warning.&lt;/p>;</content:encoded><dc:creator> Junhao Wu, Zhaocai Wang, Jinghan Dong, Xuefei Cui, Sen Tao, Xi Chen</dc:creator><category> Research Article</category><dc:title> Robust Runoff Prediction with Explainable Artificial Intelligence and Meteorological Variables from Deep Learning Ensemble Model</dc:title><dc:identifier> 10.1029/2023WR035676</dc:identifier><prism:publicationname> Water Resources Research</prism:publicationname><prism:doi> 10.1029/2023WR035676</prism:doi><prism:url> https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR035676?af=R</prism:url><prism:section> Research Article</prism:section></item><item><link/> https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR035077?af=R<pubDate> Thu, 14 Sep 2023 11:20:03 -0700</pubDate><dc:date> 2023-09-14T11:20:03-07:00</dc:date><source url="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/19447973?af=R"/> Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents <prism:coverdate></prism:coverdate><prism:coverdisplaydate></prism:coverdisplaydate><guid ispermalink="false"> 10.1029/2023WR035077</guid><title> Discharge‐mediated temperature management in a large, regulated river, with implications for management of endangered fish</title><description> Water Resources Research, Accepted Article.</description><dc:description> Abstract For large, regulated rivers, operators can impact abiotic conditions for the benefit of the ecosystem, primarily by controlling the volume of discharge from upstream reservoirs.

However, quantifying rcs is a challenging work. Here we develop an approach for estimating rcs over the globe. Comparing results over the globe and across ten ET datasets (used as inputs), which are based on diverse mechanisms and algorithms, we find that the approach can capture canopy resistance well (mean correlation of 0.84 ± 0.04, mean relative Root Mean Squared Error of 4.4 ± 1.0%, and mean relative Mean Absolute Error of 5.8 ± 1.4%), and the estimated rcs are very close to those estimated using another method (R2 = 0.92), which is based on a quite different hypothesis that is only suitable for saturated regions. Based on these, we find that the rcs shows an overall increasing trend (0.43 ± 0.13 sm‐1 year‐1) over the globe (at 77.6 ± 3.9% of the land grid cells) during 1982‐2014, and the air temperature dominates the variabilities of rcs in regions with decreasing rcs (mean relative contribution of 57.9 ± 11.4%), while air CO2 concentration controls the changes in rcs in regions with increasing rcs (mean relative contribution of 47.3 ± 8.0%). Moreover, we also find that the traditional PET estimator explicitly overestimates the increasing trends in PET, and tends to overestimate (underestimate) the increasing (decreasing) trends in regions with increasing (decreasing) PET.

However, quantifying r&lt;sub>;cs&lt;/sub>; is a challenging work. Here we develop an approach for estimating r&lt;sub>;cs&lt;/sub>; over the globe. Comparing results over the globe and across ten ET datasets (used as inputs), which are based on diverse mechanisms and algorithms, we find that the approach can capture canopy resistance well (mean correlation of 0.84 ± 0.04, mean relative Root Mean Squared Error of 4.4 ± 1.0%, and mean relative Mean Absolute Error of 5.8 ± 1.4%), and the estimated r&lt;sub>;cs&lt;/sub>; are very close to those estimated using another method (&lt;i>;R&lt;/i>; &lt;sup>;2&lt;/sup>; = 0.92), which is based on a quite different hypothesis that is only suitable for saturated regions. Based on these, we find that the r&lt;sub>;cs&lt;/sub>; shows an overall increasing trend (0.43 ± 0.13 s m&lt;sup>;-1&lt;/sup>; year&lt;sup>;-1&lt;/sup>;) over the globe (at 77.6 ± 3.9% of the land grid cells) during 1982-2014, and the air temperature dominates the variabilities of r&lt;sub>;cs&lt;/sub>; in regions with decreasing r&lt;sub>;cs&lt;/sub>; (mean relative contribution of 57.9 ± 11.4%), while air CO&lt;sub>;2&lt;/sub>; concentration controls the changes in r&lt;sub>;cs&lt;/sub>; in regions with increasing r&lt;sub>;cs&lt;/sub>; (mean relative contribution of 47.3 ± 8.0%). Moreover, we also find that the traditional PET estimator explicitly overestimates the increasing trends in PET, and tends to overestimate (underestimate) the increasing (decreasing) trends in regions with increasing (decreasing) PET. These findings can improve our knowledge on the complex water-vegetation-environment interactions and would be helpful for developing more accurate models for quantifying the impacts of global change on water resources.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This article is protected by copyright.

Accounting for the skewness and censoring characteristics of hydroclimatic variables, ensemble climatological forecasts can be generated by the log, Box‐Cox and log‐sinh transformations, by the combinations of the Bernoulli distribution with the Gaussian, Gamma, log‐normal, generalized extreme value, generalized logistic and Pearson type III distributions and by the non‐parametric resampling, empirical cumulative distribution function and kernel density estimation methods. This paper is concentrated on the reliability of the 12 types of ensemble climatological forecasts. Specifically, mathematical formulations are presented and large‐sample tests are devised to verify the forecast reliability for the Multi‐Source Weighted‐Ensemble Precipitation version 2 across the globe. Climatological forecasts of monthly precipitation over 18,425 grid cells are generated for 30 years under leave‐one‐year‐out cross validation, leading to 6,633,000 (12 × 18425 × 30) sets of ensemble climatological forecasts. The results point out that the reliability of climatological forecasts considerably varies across the 12 methods, particularly in regions with high hydroclimatic variability. One observation is that climatological forecasts tend to deviate from the distributions of observations when there is inadequate flexibility to fit precipitation data. Another observation is that ensemble spreads can be overly wide when there exist overfits of sample‐specific noises in cross validation. Through the tests of global precipitation, the robustness of the log‐sinh transformation and the Bernoulli‐Gamma distribution is highlighted. Overall, the investigations can serve as a guidance on the uses of transformations, distributions and non‐parametric methods in generating climatological forecasts.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Ensemble climatological forecasts play a critical part in benchmarking the predictive performance of hydroclimatic forecasts.

In this study, we investigate the impact of pressure pulses that emit waves in the water phase on the water distribution and imbibition patterns in porous media. We present experimental results of water spatial distribution in sand columns following infiltration under abrupt pressured‐water pulses and compare them with those of continuous inflow. Applying pressure waves during infiltration increases pressure gradients behind the wetting front, which can overcome capillary and gravitational forces, leading to uniform imbibition. To simulate the process, we developed a pore‐network model incorporating an analytical solution of pressure wave attenuation to predict the imbibition pattern. Our results demonstrate that the amplitude of the pressure wave is associated with a sharp wetting front, resulting in higher water content compared to Darcy‐type continuous flow. The findings suggest that pressure waves have the potential to achieve high water content in unsaturated media and provide insights into the spatial extent of their impact on water distribution.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The wetting front dynamics during water imbibition in dry porous media affect the ultimate water distribution pattern.

Long‐term perspectives provided by tree ring‐based reconstructions can improve understanding of factors driving variability in groundwater elevations, but such reconstructions are rare to date. Here, we report a set of new 546‐year tree‐ring chronologies developed from living and remnant longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) trees that, when combined with existing bald cypress (Taxodium distichum) tree‐ring chronologies, create a set of nested reconstructions of mean annual groundwater elevation for North Central Florida that together explain 66% of the variance in instrumental measurements and span 1498–2015. Split calibration confirms the skill of the reconstructions, but coefficient of efficiency metrics and significant autocorrelation in the regression residuals indicate a weakening relationship between tree growth and groundwater elevation over recent decades. Comparison to data from nearby groundwater wells suggests extraction of groundwater is likely contributing to this weakening signal. Periodicity within the reconstruction and comparison with global sea surface temperatures (SST) highlight the role of El Niño‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in driving groundwater elevations, but the strength of this role varies substantially over time.

Clogging of sandy streambeds has previously been studied under losing and gaining flows and during streambed movement, but not when these two flow conditions coincided. We conducted flume experiments to quantify the combined effect of moving bedforms and losing or gaining flows on kaolinite deposition and streambed clogging. The experiments were conducted by adding pulses of kaolinite in a flume packed with sand under a streamwater velocity of 25 cm/s. We measured the deposition rates, dynamics of hyporheic exchange flux (HEF) and vertical hydraulic conductivity (Kv), and the vertical distribution of kaolinite at the end of the experiments under two losing and two gaining flows (Darcy velocity of 10 and 20 cm/day). Kaolinite deposition led to clogging and reduction in Kv and HEF under all flow conditions. Deposition occurred faster under losing flow conditions than under gaining flow conditions. However, the changes in Kv and HEF were similar under losing and gaining flow conditions for similar kaolinite concentrations in the bed. Our results indicate that the deposition patterns of kaolinite were more influenced by bedform movement than by losing or gaining flow conditions, which is markedly different from the behavior observed under losing and gaining conditions for stationary bedforms. This implies that bedform morphodynamics control local‐scale clogging of sandy streambeds and should be accounted for when studying the hydrology of catchments at larger scales.

When that effluent is used for irrigation, the fate of PFAAs depends strongly on soil PFAA retention properties and effluent PFAA loading history. The relative importance of PFAA retention factors under natural field‐scale conditions remains uncertain, and the historical record of effluent PFAA concentrations is limited. Using soil cores collected from the Penn State Living Filter (irrigated with treated wastewater effluent for nearly 60 years), we evaluated PFAA mass‐balance in the irrigated soils and estimated historical effluent PFAA concentrations. Total accumulated perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) masses measured in soils in 2014 were more than 450 times greater than annual mass loads applied during the 2020 effluent irrigation. Column mass‐balance models reproduced the observed PFOS and PFOA profiles, providing an estimate of historical effluent PFOS and PFOA concentrations: 70‐170 ng L‐1 and 1000‐1300 ng L‐1, respectively. Estimated concentrations were comparable to measurements in other wastewater effluents in the 1990s and 2000s, indicating that wastewater‐irrigated soils can serve as integrated records of historical PFAA loading to the environment. Mass balance calculations suggest that PFOS breakthrough to groundwater occurred 50 years after the start of wastewater irrigation, whereas simulated PFOA breakthrough occurred after only 10 years of irrigation. While wastewater irrigation of soils facilitates retention and reduces effluent PFAA loading to surface waters, resulting PFAA storage in soils potentially creates long‐term sources of PFAAs to groundwater.

The difficulty of capturing these constraints across many basins in a generalized framework has limited the accuracy of streamflow estimates in Land Surface Models for locations downstream of reservoirs. We develop a Piece Wise Linear Regression Tree to learn generalized daily operating policies from 76 reservoirs from four major basins across the coterminous US. Reservoir characteristics, such as residence time and maximum storage, and daily state variables, such as storage and inflow, are used to group similar observations across all reservoirs. Linear regression equations are then fit between daily state variables and release for each group. We recommend two models – Model 1 (M1) that performs the best when simulating untrained records but is complex, and Model 2 (M2) that is nearly as performant as M1 but more parsimonious. The simulated release median root mean squared error is 49.7% (53.2%) of mean daily release with a median Nash‐Sutcliffe Efficiency of 0.62 (0.52) for M1 (M2). Long‐term residence time is shown to be useful in grouping similar operating reservoirs. Release from low residence time reservoirs can be mostly described using inflow‐based variables. Operations at higher residence time reservoirs are more related to previous release variables or storage variables, depending on the current inflow. The ability of the models presented to capture operational dynamics of many types of reservoirs indicates their potential to be used for untrained and limited data reservoirs.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Inflow anomalies at varying temporal scales, seasonally varying storage mandates, and multi-purpose allocation requirements contribute to reservoir operational decisions.

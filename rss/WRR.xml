The results show the efficacy and robustness of DeepGS, which significantly outperform previous methods. We also conclude that accurately reconstructing soil moisture dynamics and spatiotemporal derivatives from noisy and scarce data play a critical role in governing equation discovery.

However, an important but unresolved problem is how to reconstruct the unsaturated flow equation from highly noisy and scarce discrete data. In this study, we present a new deep-learning framework: DeepGS (Deep-learning-based Group Sparsity framework), that leverages the synergy of group sparsity and physics-informed deep learning to the latent governing equation for unsaturated flow. In particular, we design a strategy that decomposes the identification of the unsaturated flow equation into two tasks: the determination of the PDE structure and the reconstruction of the nonlinear coefficients. The tasks can be seamlessly handled by group sparse regression and the physics-informed deep learning approach. Through the training, it realizes the simultaneous reconstruction of soil moisture dynamics and unsaturated flow governing equation. A series of comprehensive numerical experiments are conducted to determine the optimal architecture and test its performance. The results show the efficacy and robustness of DeepGS, which significantly outperform previous methods.

Despite numerous progresses in modeling flow and transport over the past decades, we are still far from accurately estimating the scale dependence of soil and rock properties. In this study, we propose applying renormalization group theory (RGT) at pore scale. Using the RGT, we determine the scale dependence of effective pore‐throat radius () and develop two theoretical models to estimate permeability (k) in pore networks of various sizes. The first theoretical model estimates k(L) from the and simulated formation factor F(L), while the second model uses information at the smallest scale (L = Lmin) in addition to and F(L). By comparing with 25 pore‐network simulations, we show that the RGT estimates the scale‐dependent k reasonably well. The first model estimates k(L) with average relative errors ranged between ‐53.1 and ‐3.0%, while the second model between ‐1.0 and 14.33%. We also conduct fluid flow simulations in 40 other pore networks above the representative elementary volume (REV) and compare the results of the RGT with those of the effective‐medium approximation (EMA).

Unsatisfactory performances of MLR indicated that the relationship between the FDS and explanatory factors did not obey an explicit linear function.

However, these coupled processes are rarely documented through high‐resolution measurements focused on water‐carbon interactions. We collated a state‐of‐the‐art high‐frequency data set throughout a snowmelt and early post snowmelt period, alongside regular samples of stream water, precipitation, and snowmelt isotopes (δ18O). Our study was conducted during the 2019 snowmelt and initial post snowmelt season in a subarctic, peatland influenced headwater catchment in Pallas, Northern Finland. We measured high‐frequency dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and in‐stream carbon dioxide (pCO2). We identified a change in hydrological processes as the snowmelt season progressed and the post snowmelt season began. We found (a) Overland flow dominated stream DOC dynamics in early snowmelt, while increased catchment connectivity opened new distal pathways in the later snowmelt period; (b) CO2 processes were initially driven by rapid bursts of CO2 from the meltwaters in snowmelt, followed by dilution and source limitation emerging post snowmelt as deep soil pathways replaced the snowpack as the main source of CO2; (c) stream carbon concentration shifted from being relatively balanced between CO2 and DOC during the early snowmelt period to being increasingly DOC dominated as snowmelt progressed due to changes in DOC and CO2 source supply. The study highlights the importance of using high‐frequency measurements combined with high‐frequency data analyses to identify changes in the processes driving water‐carbon interactions.

Here we evaluate multimodel differences of these effects within the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) compared to Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) products and ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) as references in a frequency domain. The variability of SSM, Pr, and ET within three frequency bands (1/7 ∼ 1/30 days−1, 1/30 ∼ 1/90 days−1, and 1/90 ∼ 1/365 days−1) after normalization is quantified using Fourier transform. We analyze the impact of ET and Pr on SSM variability based on a transfer function assuming that these variables form a linear time‐invariant (LTI) system. For the total effects of ET and Pr on SSM variability, the CMIP5 estimations are smaller than the reference data in the two higher frequency bands and are larger than the reference data in the lowest frequency band. Besides, the effects on SSM by Pr and ET are found to be different across the three frequency bands. In each frequency band, the variability of the factor that dominates SSM (ie, Pr or ET) from CMIP5 is smaller than that from the references. This study identifies the spatiotemporal distribution of differences between CMIP5 models and references (SMAP and ERA5) in simulating ET and Pr effects on SSM within three frequency bands. This study provides insightful information on how soil moisture variability is affected by varying precipitation and evapotranspiration at different time scales within Earth System Models.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The effects of precipitation (Pr) and evapotranspiration (ET) on surface soil moisture (SSM) play an essential role in the land-atmosphere system.

The variability of SSM, Pr, and ET within three frequency bands (1/7 ∼ 1/30 days&lt;sup>;−1&lt;/sup>;, 1/30 ∼ 1/90 days&lt;sup>;−1&lt;/sup>;, and 1/90 ∼ 1/365 days&lt;sup>;−1&lt;/sup>;) after normalization is quantified using Fourier transform. We analyze the impact of ET and Pr on SSM variability based on a transfer function assuming that these variables form a linear time-invariant (LTI) system. For the total effects of ET and Pr on SSM variability, the CMIP5 estimations are smaller than the reference data in the two higher frequency bands and are larger than the reference data in the lowest frequency band. Besides, the effects on SSM by Pr and ET are found to be different across the three frequency bands. In each frequency band, the variability of the factor that dominates SSM (ie, Pr or ET) from CMIP5 is smaller than that from the references. This study identifies the spatiotemporal distribution of differences between CMIP5 models and references (SMAP and ERA5) in simulating ET and Pr effects on SSM within three frequency bands.

Many studies have reported unexpected large runoff reductions during drought, particularly for multi‐year events, and some studies report a persistent change in partitioning even after the meteorological drought has ended. This study focused on understanding how actual evapotranspiration (AET) and change in subsurface storage (ΔS) respond to climate variability and change, examining Australia&#39;s Millennium Drought (MD, 1997–2009). The study initially conducted a catchment‐scale water balance analysis to investigate interactions between ΔS and AET. Then the water balance analysis was extended to regional scale to investigate ΔS using interpolated rainfall and discharge with remotely sensed AET. Lastly, we evaluated conceptual rainfall‐runoff model performance of two commonly used models against these water balance estimates. The evaluation of water‐balance‐derived ΔS against Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) estimates shows a significant multiyear storage decline; however, with different rates. In contrast, AET rates (annualized) remained approximately constant before and during the MD, contrasting with some reports of evapotranspiration enhancement elsewhere. Overall, given AET remained approximately constant, drought‐induced precipitation reductions were partitioned into ΔS and streamflow. The employed conceptual rainfall‐runoff models failed to realistically represent AET during the MD, suggesting the need for improved conceptualization of processes. This study provides useful implications for explaining future hydrological changes if similar AET behavior is observed under a drying climate.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;To accurately project future water availability under a drying climate, it is important to understand how precipitation is partitioned into other terrestrial water balance components, such as fluxes (evaporation, transpiration, runoff) and changes in storage (soil moisture, groundwater).

In this study, a new approach, which adopted finite difference numerical schemes along with the limited‐memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno bounded (L‐BFGS‐B) parameter optimization algorithm, was developed to inversely trace vertical soil water fluxes in variably saturated zones using temperature‐depth time‐series data. The newly developed method did not utilize hydraulic parameters, and only temperature time‐series data were used at the adjacent depths as boundary conditions. The soil water, vapor flux, and spatiotemporal variations in thermal conductivity at a given location were optimized by fitting the temperature time‐series at the target depth using the L‐BFGS‐B algorithm. Further, the method was verified through laboratory experiments under different saturated conditions that were conducted in two columns with saturated and free drainage bottom boundaries, and five sets of different flow rates with a relatively stable flow condition. The soil water flux calculated using the proposed method was consistent with the observed data, thus, verifying the reliability of the approach in applications with relatively stable flow rates. Furthermore, the new method was applied to a field site to estimate the time‐varying soil water flux using the measured temperature data. The trends of the calculated soil water flux at different depths were consistent with the field hydrologic conditions and observations. Thus, this study provides a novel computationally efficient and easy‐to‐implement tool to determine soil water flux using temperature measurements.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The coexistence of water, vapor, and solid phases and the spatiotemporal changes in thermal conductivities in response to variations in water content pose a challenge to the heat-tracing method used to calculate water flux in variably saturated zones.

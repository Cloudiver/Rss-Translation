Daily GWET, total evapotranspiration (ET), groundwater recharge, base flow, and total runoff are simulated by the Integrated Hydrologic Model, which dynamically couples a surface water model (HSPF) and a groundwater flow model (MODFLOW). The roles of GWET on long-term water balance are quantified by four ratios. The ratios of GWET to total available water, watershed wetting, ET, and recharge decrease exponentially with watershed aridity index, which is defined as the ratio of potential evapotranspiration to total available water. In the one-stage precipitation partitioning framework, the contribution of GWET to the ratio between total ET and available water for ET (ie, the y-axis of Budyko curve) decreases with watershed aridity index. In the two-stage precipitation partitioning framework, the contribution of GWET to the ratio between total ET and watershed wetting (ie, Horton index) decreases with watershed aridity index. The changes in GWET caused by intra-monthly climate variability are the highest among the temporal scales of climate variability investigated to understand controls on GWET. The inter-annual, intra-annual and intra-monthly climate variabilities lead to increase of GWET; but the sub-daily climate variability results in decrease of GWET. For the third stage of partitioning, given the same ratio of potential GWET to available water for GWET, higher percentage of forest &amp; wetland and lower percentage of impervious land contribute to higher ratio of GWET to available water for GWET.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This article is protected by copyright.

Here, we developed an analytical plant hydraulic scheme wherein hydraulic capacitances at the leaf level and stem level were considered, and incorporated it into the vegetation interface processes model (hereafter, VIP‐PHS). Then, we calibrated the VIP‐PHS parameters using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method and conducted an ecosystem‐scale evaluation of the VIP‐PHS at 30 FLUXNET sites. The results showed that VIP‐PHS improved evapotranspiration (ET) and gross primary production (GPP) simulations across the studied sites, reducing the root mean square error (RMSE) by 0.02–0.27 mm day−1 and 0.04–0.52 g C m−2 day−1 in relation to the empirical soil hydraulic scheme (hereafter, VIP‐SHS). VIP‐PHS decreased the RMSE in ET and GPP by up to 45% and 55% in evergreen needleleaf forests. Compared to VIP‐SHS, VIP‐PHS decreased the sensitivities of ET and GPP to soil moisture stress, and significantly improved ET and GPP predictions under low soil moisture conditions. The sensitivity analysis showed that larger stem hydraulic capacitance better relieved xylem water stress, resulting in greater transpiration and GPP and less‐negative daily minimum stem water potential. These findings highlight the need to incorporate plant hydraulics into the next generation of Earth system models under future drought conditions.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Land surface models typically ignore plant hydraulic processes and use empirical soil moisture stress functions to limit transpiration and photosynthesis.

However, data points in the recession plot, the plot of −dQ/dt versus Q, typically form a wide point cloud due to noise and hysteresis in the storage‐discharge relationship, and it is still unclear what information we can extract from the plot and how to understand the information. There seem to be two contrasting approaches to interpret the plot. One emphasizes the importance of the ensemble characteristics of many recessions (ie, the lower envelope or a measure of central tendency), and the other highlights the importance of the event scale analysis and questions the meaning of the ensemble characteristics. We examine if those approaches can be reconciled. We utilize a machine learning tool to capture the point cloud using the past trajectory of daily discharge. Our model results for a catchment show that most of the data points can be captured using 5 days of past discharge. We show that we can learn the catchment scale flow recession dynamics from what the machine learned. We analyze patterns learned by the machine and explain and hypothesize why the machine learned those characteristics. The hysteresis in the plot mainly occurs during the early time dynamics, and the flow recession dynamics eventually converge to an attractor in the plot, which represents the master recession curve. We also illustrate that a hysteretic storage‐discharge relationship can be estimated based on the attractor.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Flow recession analysis, relating discharge &lt;i>;Q&lt;/i>; and its time rate of change −&lt;i>;dQ&lt;/i>;/&lt;i>;dt&lt;/i>;, has been widely used to understand catchment scale flow dynamics.

Water risks stem from biophysical dimensions of groundwater depletion, low surface water flows, and degraded quality, and, contextual dimensions of regulatory uncertainty, public concerns and perception. While academic, policy, and practitioner interest is growing, literature reveals major gaps in comprehensive assessment of multidimensional water risks at the subwatershed scale. Addressing these gaps, the study developed a locally attuned and interdisciplinary water risk assessment framework. Using secondary mixed data analysis, the study integrated quantitative and qualitative data for water quantity and quality risks, regulatory trends, water user conflicts for 38 subwatersheds in Ontario. The framework identifies subwatersheds and sectors at high, moderate, and low risk along with media and public concern themes. The study finds high and moderate risk potential in at least 50% of studied subwatersheds for all water risk indicators and challenges the myth of water abundance in Great Lakes watershed of Ontario. The study advances knowledge in water risk assessment by applying social‐ecological perspectives, interdisciplinary approaches of Risk Theory, and mixed methods to provide a comprehensive evaluation of water security and demonstrates integration of social science perspectives in the field of sociohydrology. Our framework assesses interdisciplinary water risks to inform multisector sustainable water management decisions.

Thus, in recent decades, various models that incorporate storage‐zone effects have been proposed to characterize anomalous storage mechanisms. The validity of these models has been predominantly demonstrated using tracer breakthrough curves measured in surface flow. However, the storage effect is usually less influential on the breakthrough curve behavior than in‐stream flow dynamics. Thus, for model validation, the tracer behavior within the storage zone should be investigated separately. The present study aims to quantify the time‐dependent storage effect, herein termed the net retention time distribution (NRTD), from tracer measurements in the flow zone using a deconvolution technique with manipulation in the Fourier domain. The results demonstrated that the deconvolved NRTDs successfully represented the temporal behavior of the tracer in the storage zones without significant distortion in the primary information of the observed breakthrough curves. Using estimates of NRTD, we evaluated the simulations of the transient storage model, and found that the storage effects were underestimated as much as an average 18.5% in this study. The deconvolved NRTDs were also utilized to predict the biodegradation losses of organic chemicals flowing along a stream at confidence intervals.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Because of the influence of various storage zones, solute transport in a stream channel cannot be interpreted by advection and dispersion processes alone.

While decades of research have focused on the physical processes of MAR and identifying suitable MAR locations, very little research has been done on how to consider competing factors and tradeoffs in siting MAR facilities. This study proposes the use of a simulation‐optimization (SO) framework to map out a cost‐effectiveness frontier for MAR by combining an evolutionary algorithm with two objective functions that seek to maximize groundwater storage gains while minimizing MAR cost. We present the theoretical framework along with a real‐world application to California&#39;s Central Valley. The result of the SO framework is a Pareto front that allows identifying suitable MAR locations for different levels of groundwater storage gain and associated MAR project costs, so stakeholders can evaluate different choices based on cost, benefits, and tradeoffs of MAR sites. Application of the SO framework to the Central Valley shows groundwater can be recharged from high‐magnitude (95th percentile) flows at a marginal cost of $57 to $110 million per km3. If the 10 percent largest flows are recharged the total groundwater storage gain would double and the marginal costs would drop to between $30 and $50 million per km3. If recharge water is sourced from outside local basins (eg, the Sacramento‐San Joaquin Delta), groundwater storage gain is approximately 25%–80% greater than can be achieved by recharging local flows, but the total cost is about 10%–15% higher because of additional lift cost.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Managed aquifer recharge (MAR) can provide long-term storage of excess surface water for later use.

The result of the SO framework is a Pareto front that allows identifying suitable MAR locations for different levels of groundwater storage gain and associated MAR project costs, so stakeholders can evaluate different choices based on cost, benefits, and tradeoffs of MAR sites. Application of the SO framework to the Central Valley shows groundwater can be recharged from high-magnitude (95th percentile) flows at a marginal cost of $57 to $110 million per km&lt;sup>;3&lt;/sup>;. If the 10 percent largest flows are recharged the total groundwater storage gain would double and the marginal costs would drop to between $30 and $50 million per km&lt;sup>;3&lt;/sup>;. If recharge water is sourced from outside local basins (eg, the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta), groundwater storage gain is approximately 25%–80% greater than can be achieved by recharging local flows, but the total cost is about 10%–15% higher because of additional lift cost.&lt;/p>;</content:encoded><dc:creator> Georgios Kourakos, Giuseppe Brunetti, Daniel P.

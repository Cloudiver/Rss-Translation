Here, we use annually‐resolved tree‐ring records to develop the first multi‐century reconstruction of Oregon Cascade April 1st Snow Water Equivalent (SWE). The model explains 58% of observed snowpack variability and extends back to 1688 AD, nearly quintupling the length of the existing snowpack record. Our reconstruction suggests that only one other multiyear event in the last three centuries was as severe as the 2014‐2015 snow drought. The 2015 event alone was more severe than nearly any other year in over three centuries. Extreme low‐to‐high snowpack &#39;whiplash&#39; transitions are a consistent feature throughout the reconstructed record. Multi‐decadal intervals of persistent below‐the‐mean peak SWE are prominent features of pre‐instrumental snowpack variability, but are generally absent from the instrumental period and likely not fully accounted for in modern water management. In the face of projected snow drought intensification and warming, our findings motivate adaptive management strategies that address declining snowpack and increasingly variable precipitation regimes.

However, an important but unresolved problem is how to reconstruct the unsaturated flow equation from highly noisy and scarce discrete data. In this study, we present a new deep‐learning framework: DeepGS (Deep‐learning‐based Group Sparsity framework), that leverages the synergy of group sparsity and physics‐informed deep learning to the latent governing equation for unsaturated flow. In particular, we design a strategy that decomposes the identification of the unsaturated flow equation into two tasks: the determination of the PDE structure and the reconstruction of the nonlinear coefficients. The tasks can be seamlessly handled by group sparse regression and the physics‐informed deep learning approach. Through the training, it realizes the simultaneous reconstruction of soil moisture dynamics and unsaturated flow governing equation. A series of comprehensive numerical experiments are conducted to determine the optimal architecture and test its performance. The results show the efficacy and robustness of DeepGS, which significantly outperform previous methods. We also conclude that accurately reconstructing soil moisture dynamics and spatiotemporal derivatives from noisy and scarce data play a critical role in governing equation discovery.

In this study, we present a new deep-learning framework: DeepGS (Deep-learning-based Group Sparsity framework), that leverages the synergy of group sparsity and physics-informed deep learning to the latent governing equation for unsaturated flow. In particular, we design a strategy that decomposes the identification of the unsaturated flow equation into two tasks: the determination of the PDE structure and the reconstruction of the nonlinear coefficients. The tasks can be seamlessly handled by group sparse regression and the physics-informed deep learning approach. Through the training, it realizes the simultaneous reconstruction of soil moisture dynamics and unsaturated flow governing equation. A series of comprehensive numerical experiments are conducted to determine the optimal architecture and test its performance. The results show the efficacy and robustness of DeepGS, which significantly outperform previous methods. We also conclude that accurately reconstructing soil moisture dynamics and spatiotemporal derivatives from noisy and scarce data play a critical role in governing equation discovery. This study further demonstrates the potential of discovering the governing equation for unsaturated flow from data in more complex scenarios, where rich and accurate soil moisture observations are generally intractable to access.&lt;/p>;</content:encoded><dc:creator> Wenxiang Song, Liangsheng Shi, Xiaolong Hu, Yanling Wang, Lijun Wang</dc:creator><category> Research Article</category><dc:title> Reconstructing the Unsaturated Flow Equation from Sparse and Noisy Data: Leveraging the Synergy of Group Sparsity and Physics‐Informed Deep Learning</dc:title><dc:identifier> 10.1029/2022WR034122</dc:identifier><prism:publicationname> Water Resources Research</prism:publicationname><prism:doi> 10.1029/2022WR034122</prism:doi><prism:url> https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022WR034122?af=R</prism:url><prism:section> Research Article</prism:section></item><item><link/> https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022WR033669?af=R<pubDate> Wed, 03 May 2023 08:39:53 -0700</pubDate><dc:date> 2023-05-03T08:39:53-07:00</dc:date><source url="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/19447973?af=R"/> Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents <prism:coverdate></prism:coverdate><prism:coverdisplaydate></prism:coverdisplaydate><guid ispermalink="false"> 10.1029/2022WR033669</guid><title> Reduction of Multi‐Port Water Distribution Networks using the Generalized Thevenin Theorem</title><description> Water Resources Research, Accepted Article.</description><dc:description> Abstract Expansion and reorganization of water distribution networks by connecting sub‐networks via single or multiple pipes are common practices in developing cities to serve newly developed areas.

Here we experimented with three different formulas in a global hydrological model (the World‐wide HYPE), using 15 years of observations from 5,338 streamflow gauges and global evapotranspiration from Earth‐observations (MOD16). We tested model performance in a multi‐process approach to select the best formula for catchments covering the global landmass. From comparing the results with land‐cover, climate classification, water‐energy limitations, we found that climate is the main driver behind the spatial patterns in model performance. Hargreaves was the best PET formula in 50% of the catchments, most of them located in the Amazonas, central Europe, and Oceania; Jensen‐Haise was better for catchments in northern latitudes (36%). Finally, Priestley‐Taylor was the best formula for India and latitudes above 65⁰ North. The selection of a PET formula seems to be more critical in tropical regions close to the equator, where the differences in performance are above 50%. This is also where PET is highest. We found a strong connection between the five main Köppen regions and the PET formulas, further supported by landcover analysis. Hence, the PET formulas differed in their capacity to provide useful input to the water balance modelling, with complex formulas only giving improved predictions in temperate and polar regions; however, for the rest of the globe simpler formulas were better. We thus recommend to apply different PET formulas based on climatic regions world‐wide.

Despite numerous progresses in modeling flow and transport over the past decades, we are still far from accurately estimating the scale dependence of soil and rock properties. In this study, we propose applying renormalization group theory (RGT) at pore scale. Using the RGT, we determine the scale dependence of effective pore‐throat radius () and develop two theoretical models to estimate permeability (k) in pore networks of various sizes. The first theoretical model estimates k(L) from the and simulated formation factor F(L), while the second model uses information at the smallest scale (L = Lmin) in addition to and F(L). By comparing with 25 pore‐network simulations, we show that the RGT estimates the scale‐dependent k reasonably well. The first model estimates k(L) with average relative errors ranged between ‐53.1 and ‐3.0%, while the second model between ‐1.0 and 14.33%. We also conduct fluid flow simulations in 40 other pore networks above the representative elementary volume (REV) and compare the results of the RGT with those of the effective‐medium approximation (EMA). Results showed that both the RGT and EMA accurately estimates k from pore‐throat radius distribution and formation factor with RMSLE = 0.119 and 0.096, respectively.

The first model estimates &lt;i>;k&lt;/i>;(&lt;i>;L&lt;/i>;) with average relative errors ranged between -53.1 and -3.0%, while the second model between -1.0 and 14.33%. We also conduct fluid flow simulations in 40 other pore networks above the representative elementary volume (REV) and compare the results of the RGT with those of the effective-medium approximation (EMA). Results showed that both the RGT and EMA accurately estimates &lt;i>;k&lt;/i>; from pore-throat radius distribution and formation factor with RMSLE = 0.119 and 0.096, respectively.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This article is protected by copyright.

However, it is unclear which are beneficial DWS configurations, ie, where and at what scale to implement distributed water supply. We develop a mesoscale representation model that approximates DWSs with reduced backbone networks to enable efficient system emulation while preserving key physical realism. Moreover, system emulation allows us to build a multiobjective optimization model for computational policy search that addresses energy utilization and economic impacts. We demonstrate our models on a hypothetical DWS with distributed direct potable reuse (DPR) based on the City of Houston&#39;s water and wastewater infrastructure. The backbone DWS with greater than link and node reductions achieves satisfactory approximation of global flows and water pressures, to enable configuration optimization analysis. Results from the optimization model reveal case‐specific as well as general opportunities, constraints, and their interactions for DPR allocation. Implementing DPR can be beneficial in areas with high energy intensities of water distribution, considerable local water demands, and commensurate wastewater reuse capacities. The mesoscale modeling approach and the multiobjective optimization model developed in this study can serve as practical decision‐support tools for stakeholders to search for alternative DWS options in urban settings.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;It is widely acknowledged that distributed water systems (DWSs), which integrate distributed water supply and treatment with existing centralized infrastructure, can mitigate challenges to water security from extreme events, climate change, and aged infrastructure.

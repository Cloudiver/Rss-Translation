We used 5‐min rainfall and storm runoff data for 30 events to calibrate the Green–Ampt (GA) and the Spatially Variable Infiltration (SVI) models and predict runoff responses for a small, degraded grassland catchment on Leyte Island (the Philippines), where infiltration‐excess overland flow (IOF) is considered the dominant runoff process. SVI replicated individual stormflow hydrographs better than GA, particularly for events with small runoff responses or multiple peaks. Calibrated parameter values of the SVI model (ie, spatially averaged maximum infiltration capacity, Im and initial abstraction, F0) varied markedly between events, but were statistically significant and negatively correlated with (mid‐slope) soil moisture content at 10 cm (SWC10)—as did the “catchment‐wide effective” hydraulic conductivity (Ke) of the GA model. Using SWC10‐based estimates of F0 and Im in SVI yielded satisfactory to good simulations for 11 out of 17 events with runoff coefficients ≥15%, but failed to reproduce the hydrographs for events with very small runoff amounts (0.25–1 mm) and low runoff coefficients (3%–6%). The median field‐measured near‐surface Ksat (2 mm hr−1) was distinctly lower than the median Im (32 mm hr−1) and, to a lesser extent, Ke (∼8 mm hr−1), suggesting an underestimation of the spatially averaged Ksat by the field measurements. Application of SVI is expected to give the most realistic results for situations where IOF is dominant, that is, where surface conditions are degraded and rainfall intensities high.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Predicting catchment stormflow responses after tropical deforestation remains difficult.

The Oregon Cascade Range is highly sensitive to warming and as a result has experienced the largest mountain snowpack losses in the western US since the mid‐20th century, including a record‐breaking snow drought in 2014–2015 that culminated in a state of emergency. While Oregon Cascade snowpacks serve as the state&#39;s primary water supply, short instrumental records limit water managers&#39; ability to fully constrain long‐term natural snowpack variability prior to the influence of ongoing and projected anthropogenic climate change. Here, we use annually‐resolved tree‐ring records to develop the first multi‐century reconstruction of Oregon Cascade April 1st Snow Water Equivalent (SWE). The model explains 58% of observed snowpack variability and extends back to 1688 AD, nearly quintupling the length of the existing snowpack record. Our reconstruction suggests that only one other multiyear event in the last three centuries was as severe as the 2014–2015 snow drought. The 2015 event alone was more severe than nearly any other year in over three centuries. Extreme low‐to‐high snowpack “whiplash” transitions are a consistent feature throughout the reconstructed record. Multi‐decadal intervals of persistent below‐the‐mean peak SWE are prominent features of pre‐instrumental snowpack variability, but are generally absent from the instrumental period and likely not fully accounted for in modern water management. In the face of projected snow drought intensification and warming, our findings motivate adaptive management strategies that address declining snowpack and increasingly variable precipitation regimes.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The western United States (US) is a hotspot for snow drought.

Here we experimented with three different formulas in a global hydrological model (the World‐wide HYPE), using 15 years of observations from 5,338 streamflow gauges and global evapotranspiration from Earth‐observations (MOD16). We tested model performance in a multi‐process approach to select the best formula for catchments covering the global landmass. From comparing the results with land‐cover, climate classification, water‐energy limitations, we found that climate is the main driver behind the spatial patterns in model performance. Hargreaves was the best PET formula in 50% of the catchments, most of them located in the Amazonas, central Europe, and Oceania; Jensen‐Haise was better for catchments in northern latitudes (36%). Finally, Priestley‐Taylor was the best formula for India and latitudes above 65° North. The selection of a PET formula seems to be more critical in tropical regions close to the equator, where the differences in performance are above 50%. This is also where PET is highest. We found a strong connection between the five main Köppen regions and the PET formulas, further supported by landcover analysis. Hence, the PET formulas differed in their capacity to provide useful input to the water balance modeling, with complex formulas only giving improved predictions in temperate and polar regions; however, for the rest of the globe simpler formulas were better. We thus recommend to apply different PET formulas based on climatic regions world‐wide.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Although many potential evapotranspiration (PET) formulas are available, there is still a lack of knowledge on when and where to use them in catchment modeling world-wide.

In this study, combinations of different structures—that is, boxes, steps and a new type of subsurface structure (L‐shaped structure)—were considered to evaluate their potential applicability on river restoration. Flow‐3D and COMSOL were applied to simulate surface and subsurface flow, respectively. The performance of the structures was evaluated on the basis of hyporheic flow and residence time distributions. For the structure sizes here considered, results showed for steps (single step, combination of two steps) and L‐shaped structures (single L‐shaped structure, combination of two L‐shaped structures) most hyporheic flowpaths return to the stream after 5 and 2.5 hr, respectively. Instead, shorter residence times (&lt;0.25 hr) were found for boxes (single box, combination of two boxes). For combinations of steps and permeable boxes, the values of hyporheic flow per unit width are higher (0.35 and 0.3 m2/hr, respectively) than for the combination of L‐shaped (0.06 m2/hr). As a result, the combinations of steps and boxes are more effective in increasing hyporheic flow. However, when subsurface structures are combined with steps the resulting hyporheic exchange is dominated by the steps. Therefore, the combined use of in‐stream and subsurface structures separately may increase their benefits for hyporheic exchange, but when steps are the other subsurface structures provide minor advantages.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The deployment of artificial structures in streambeds has been proposed as a way to enhance 21 hyporheic exchange, and numerical models can be used to quantify their effects.

While decades of research have focused on the physical processes of MAR and identifying suitable MAR locations, very little research has been done on how to consider competing factors and tradeoffs in siting MAR facilities. This study proposes the use of a simulation‐optimization (SO) framework to map out a cost‐effectiveness frontier for MAR by combining an evolutionary algorithm with two objective functions that seek to maximize groundwater storage gains while minimizing MAR cost. We present the theoretical framework along with a real‐world application to California&#39;s Central Valley. The result of the SO framework is a Pareto front that allows identifying suitable MAR locations for different levels of groundwater storage gain and associated MAR project costs, so stakeholders can evaluate different choices based on cost, benefits, and tradeoffs of MAR sites. Application of the SO framework to the Central Valley shows groundwater can be recharged from high‐magnitude (95th percentile) flows at a marginal cost of $57 to $110 million per km3. If the 10 percent largest flows are recharged the total groundwater storage gain would double and the marginal costs would drop to between $30 and $50 million per km3. If recharge water is sourced from outside local basins (eg the Sacramento‐San Joaquin Delta), groundwater storage gain is approximately 25% to 80% greater than can be achieved by recharging local flows, but the total cost is about 10‐15% higher because of additional lift cost.

However, the state and movement of soil water in the DVZ remain poorly understood owing to the lack of in‐situ observations. Here, based on a 48‐m deep caisson (Critical Zone Observatory, CZO) established in a typical irrigated farmland in the piedmont region of the North China Plain (NCP), we extended the monitoring of soil water content and matric potential across the entire vadose zone profile. We found that a high soil water content and matric potential (close to or slightly higher than the field capacity) was maintained in the DVZ of typical irrigated cropland. The response of soil water in the DVZ to the water inputs at the ground surface was predominantly sequentially delayed with an increase in depth in the DVZ. As a result, the wetting front propagated into the soil layer to a depth of 38 m within 228 days. Moreover, high soil moisture contents and matric potentials in the DVZ resulted in a dramatic but explicable difference between the estimated average pore water velocity (0.73 m·year‐1) and the wetting front propagation rate (0.16 m·day‐1). This study demonstrates the unreported rapid response of soil water in the DVZ to water input at the ground surface under intensively irrigated cropland and could promote a better understanding of groundwater recharge processes with a thick unsaturated zone.

Following screening, a small number of articles (40) were found relevant, representing studies quantifying non‐point source nutrient losses from urban and peri‐urban environments. Evidence was split between plot‐ and catchment‐scale. Plot‐scale studies often included evaluations of engineered nature‐based solutions. At catchment‐scale, studies of streamwater quality typically investigated influence of contributory catchment nutrient sources. Wide ranges of beneficial reductions were apparent, and at both scales not all studies identified significant benefits. Summarising against this backdrop, at plot (micro‐) scale woodland reduces mean concentrations in runoff, soil or groundwater by an average of 44.2% for total nitrogen (TN) and 47.0% for total phosphorus (TP). At catchment (meso‐) scale, evidence suggests a 20% areal addition of forest at the expense of mixed urban fabric can reduce mean concentrations by 15.7% and 12.6% for TN and TP respectively. Additionally, some articles reveal potential drawbacks reducing benefits provided specifically by street trees and riparian woodland. Leaf litter falling on impervious surfaces can heighten risk of TP leaching to streams, but has little impact on TN. Riparian woodland was found to have complex water quality impacts.

We consider both constant‐rate and variable‐rate pumping tests, and a variety of Theis‐based solution methodologies (single‐ and multiple‐observation well methods, and interpreted single value or transient values for T and S parameters) applied in pumping test data analysis. Our results indicate that achieving reliable inference of effective T and S requires that pumping be continued until the radius of the test‐induced cone of depression exceeds a “representative length” that corresponds to ∼15 times than the correlation length scale of the aquifer heterogeneity. Independent of solution type, pumping history, correlation length scale, magnitude of the sill, and location of observation well, the estimates for T will converge toward the geometric mean. For S, the estimation uncertainty is relatively large for observation wells that are close to the pumping well, but diminishes for observation wells located beyond the representative distance, resulting in convergence to the arithmetic mean. Given that these results have practical implications for how pumping tests should be carried out, we present a simple “rule‐of‐thumb” for estimating the correlation length scale of the heterogeneity of an aquifer.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;We study the sensitivity of aquifer-scale estimates of transmissivity (&lt;i>;T&lt;/i>;) and storativity (&lt;i>;S&lt;/i>;) to the variance and correlation length scale of aquifer heterogeneity, when such estimates are obtained by the traditional approach of analyzing pumping test data.

Here, we propose a continuum model that resolves the nonlinear coupling of preferential melt flow and the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of ice‐melt phase change at the Darcy scale. We assume that the commonly observed unstable melt infiltration is due to the gravity fingering instability and capture it using the modified Richards equation, which is extended with a higher‐order term in saturation. Our model accounts for changes in porosity and the thermal budget of the snowpack caused by melt refreezing at the continuum scale, based on a mechanistic estimate of the ice‐water phase change kinetics formulated at the pore scale. We validate the model in 1D against field data and laboratory experiments of infiltration in snow and find generally good agreement. Compared to existing theory of stable melt infiltration, our 2D simulation results show that preferential infiltration delivers melt faster to deeper depths, and as a result, changes in porosity and temperature can occur at deeper parts of the snow. The simulations also capture the formation of vertical low porosity annulus known as ice pipes, which have been observed in the field but lack mechanistic understanding to date. Our results demonstrate how melt refreezing and unstable infiltration reshape the porosity structure of snow and impacts thermal and mass transport in highly nonlinear ways that are not captured by simpler models.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The transport of meltwater through porous snow is a fundamental process in hydrology that remains poorly understood but essential for more robust predictions of how the cryosphere will respond under climate change.

Despite numerous progress in modeling flow and transport over the past decades, we are still far from accurately estimating the scale dependence of soil and rock properties. In this study, we propose applying renormalization group theory (RGT) at the pore scale. Using the RGT, we determine the scale dependence of effective pore‐throat radius (rteff) and develop two theoretical models to estimate permeability (k) in pore networks of various sizes. The first theoretical model estimates k(L) from the rteff(L) and simulated formation factor F(L), while the second model uses information at the smallest scale (L = Lmin) in addition to rteff(L) and F(L). By comparing with 25 pore‐network simulations, we show that the RGT estimates the scale‐dependent k reasonably well. The first model estimates k(L) with average relative errors ranged between −53.1% and −3.0%, while the second model between −1.0% and 14.33%. We also conduct fluid flow simulations in 40 other pore networks above the representative elementary volume and compare the results of the RGT with those of the effective‐medium approximation (EMA). Results showed that both RGT and EMA accurately estimate k from pore‐throat radius distribution and formation factor with root mean square log‐transformed error = 0.119 and 0.096, respectively.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Investigating hydraulic and petrophysical properties of porous media has been an active area of research.

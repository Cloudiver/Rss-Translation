Atlantic and Pacific sea surface temperatures modulate ENSO influences, and comparisons to multiple proxy‐based reconstructions indicate an inconsistent and weaker influence of ENSO prior to the 1800s.

Long-term perspectives provided by tree ring-based reconstructions can improve understanding of factors driving variability in groundwater elevations, but such reconstructions are rare to date. Here, we report a set of new 546-year tree-ring chronologies developed from living and remnant longleaf pine (&lt;i>;Pinus palustris&lt;/i>;) trees that, when combined with existing bald cypress (&lt;i>;Taxodium distichum&lt;/i>;) tree-ring chronologies, create a set of nested reconstructions of mean annual groundwater elevation for North Central Florida that together explain 66% of the variance in instrumental measurements and span 1498–2015. Split calibration confirms the skill of the reconstructions, but coefficient of efficiency metrics and significant autocorrelation in the regression residuals indicate a weakening relationship between tree growth and groundwater elevation over recent decades. Comparison to data from nearby groundwater wells suggests extraction of groundwater is likely contributing to this weakening signal. Periodicity within the reconstruction and comparison with global sea surface temperatures highlight the role of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in driving groundwater elevations, but the strength of this role varies substantially over time.

However, most analytical solutions previously developed to estimate pumping‐induced seawater intrusion considered a horizontal aquifer bed. In this study, we first developed a steady‐state analytical solution to quantify the maximum safe pumping rate in sloping unconfined coastal aquifers with a fixed‐flux inland boundary condition, using the single potential approach. The analytical solution corrected by an empirical factor is validated against the numerical simulation, which reproduces the corresponding numerical results well. It is found that coastal aquifers with a higher aquifer bed towards inland (ie, a positive sloping angle) yield a higher maximum safe pumping rate than that of coastal aquifers with a horizontal aquifer base, since the elevated freshwater head prevents seawater intrusion and enhances groundwater pumping. Specifically, for the aquifer bases with the sloping angle of 0.01 and ‐0.01, the maximum safe pumping rate is increased by 42.6% and decreased by 48.4%, respectively, in comparison to the case of a horizontal aquifer base, suggesting that neglecting the aquifer base slop can result in a significant error in estimating the maximum safe pumping rate. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis reveals that the maximum safe pumping rate increases with a lower hydraulic conductivity and a larger dispersivity. Our results provide valuable insights into the effect of the aquifer base slope on the maximum safe pumping in coastal aquifers, and analytical solutions developed can serve as a powerful tool for quick assessment of pumping‐induced seawater intrusion in sloping unconfined coastal aquifers.

It is found that coastal aquifers with a higher aquifer bed towards inland (ie, a positive sloping angle) yield a higher maximum safe pumping rate than that of coastal aquifers with a horizontal aquifer base, since the elevated freshwater head prevents seawater intrusion and enhances groundwater pumping. Specifically, for the aquifer bases with the sloping angle of 0.01 and -0.01, the maximum safe pumping rate is increased by 42.6% and decreased by 48.4%, respectively, in comparison to the case of a horizontal aquifer base, suggesting that neglecting the aquifer base slop can result in a significant error in estimating the maximum safe pumping rate. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis reveals that the maximum safe pumping rate increases with a lower hydraulic conductivity and a larger dispersivity. Our results provide valuable insights into the effect of the aquifer base slope on the maximum safe pumping in coastal aquifers, and analytical solutions developed can serve as a powerful tool for quick assessment of pumping-induced seawater intrusion in sloping unconfined coastal aquifers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This article is protected by copyright.

However, predicting a wide range of 3D physical rocks remains a formidable challenge and requires a large amount of input. Reliable microstructure‐property correlations can accurately predict 3D physical properties, avoiding time‐consuming experimental testing. Here, we propose a new dimensionless CNN‐based method to find inherent correlations for accurately predicting 3D properties of porous rocks using only a single 2D slice or a series of 2D slices. Training and testing were conducted on 9 properties of 16,409 semi‐realistic 3D porous rocks.

Furthermore, the modeling results indicate that the network architecture of the model has a significant impact on its performance. The classical CNN Model 4 achieved an average validating loss of 1.0×10‐3. Interval 2D slice sampling can significantly reduce the computational cost in training model. The developed model was verified and tested by five independent porous samples. Additionally, the proposed method accurately predicted permeability in different directions using only 2D slices trained in one direction, for porous rocks where anisotropy is not significant. This work demonstrates the ability to predict various 3D properties rapidly and accurately using only a single 2D slice from semi‐realistic 3D volumes.

Compared to the standard, linear Darcy&#39;s law, such enhanced flux relations increase both the degree of nonlinearity, and, in the case of multiphysics simulations, coupling strength between processes.

The standard approach is therefore to ignore nonlinearities in the permeability during linearization. For finite volume methods, which are popular in porous media applications, complete linearization is feasible only for the simplest flux discretization, namely the two‐point flux approximation. We introduce an approximated linearization scheme for finite volume methods that is exact for the two‐point scheme and can be applied to more advanced and accurate discretizations, exemplified herein by a multi‐point flux stencil. We test the new method for both nonlinear porous media flow and several multiphysics simulations. Our results show that the new linearization consistently outperforms the standard approach.

We introduce an approximated linearization scheme for finite volume methods that is exact for the two-point scheme and can be applied to more advanced and accurate discretizations, exemplified herein by a multi-point flux stencil. We test the new method for both nonlinear porous media flow and several multiphysics simulations. Our results show that the new linearization consistently outperforms the standard approach. Moreover our scheme achieves asymptotic second order convergence of the Newton iterations, in contrast to the linear convergence obtained with the standard approach.&lt;/p>;</content:encoded><dc:creator> Ivar Stefansson, Eirik Keilegavlen</dc:creator><category> Research Article</category><dc:title> Numerical Treatment of State‐Dependent Permeability in Multiphysics Problems</dc:title><dc:identifier> 10.1029/2023WR034686</dc:identifier><prism:publicationname> Water Resources Research</prism:publicationname><prism:doi> 10.1029/2023WR034686</prism:doi><prism:url> https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR034686?af=R</prism:url><prism:section> Research Article</prism:section><prism:volume> 59</prism:volume><prism:number> 8</prism:number></item><item><link/> https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022WR034399?af=R<pubDate> Fri, 18 Aug 2023 08:12:18 -0700</pubDate><dc:date> 2023-08-18T08:12:18-07:00</dc:date><source url="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/19447973?af=R"/> Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents<prism:coverdate> Tue, 01 Aug 2023 00:00:00 -0700</prism:coverdate><prism:coverdisplaydate> Tue, 01 Aug 2023 00:00:00 -0700</prism:coverdisplaydate><guid ispermalink="false"> 10.1029/2022WR034399</guid><title> Temporal and Spatial Evolution of Herbivorous Waterbird Habitat in Floodplain Wetland Driven by Hydrology</title><description> Water Resources Research, Volume 59, Issue 8, August 2023.</description><dc:description> Abstract The hydrological rhythm of floodplain wetlands affected by natural climate variability and human activities is the driving factor affecting the distribution of herbivorous geese habitats. It has always been challenging to determine its long‐term variation, due to the lack of data on species distribution and broad wetland observation. In this study, the key normalized difference vegetation index threshold range suitable for herbivorous geese, greater white‐fronted geese (Anser albifrons, GWG) and bean geese (Anser fabalis, BG), was discovered by combining GPS tracking data with Landsat satellite data. The suitable habitat area and distribution variation characteristics of GWG and BG from 1982 to 2020 were extracted based on the threshold range. The results showed that the suitable habitat area had a declining trend after 2003, that the distribution had moved toward the lake&#39;s center, and that its average elevation had decreased by around 1 m, particularly during the arrival period. The change of herbivorous geese habitat is caused by the continuous drying of Poyang Lake. The study can offer a rational scientific foundation for wetland waterbird protection and watershed hydrological management.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The hydrological rhythm of floodplain wetlands affected by natural climate variability and human activities is the driving factor affecting the distribution of herbivorous geese habitats.

We use outputs from the HighResMIP suite to simulate annual maximum discharge with the Hillslope‐Link Model (HLM) at ∼1000 river communities across Iowa.

Next, we force the HLM with precipitation, temperature, and potential evapotranspiration from HighResMIP models to simulate flood peaks, finding all models/members produce empirical distributions similar to our reference. However, significant biases exist in the model/member forcings as correct flood response is being generated for the wrong reason. To improve their suitability for community‐level assessment, we use nine statistical approaches to bias‐correct and downscale HighResMIP precipitation to a 4‐km resolution. The bias‐correction and downscaling of climate model precipitation performs well for all models/members. Furthermore, we do not find significant changes in the magnitude flood peak projections for Iowa based on the HLM forced with HighResMIP outputs, or based on routed runoff, while there are indications that the variability in flood peaks is projected to increase across the state.

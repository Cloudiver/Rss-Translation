As a proof of concept, we simulate 40 years of daily precipitation records from 1000 gauging stations in the Mississippi River basin.

However, while existing stochastic simulation methods are mature enough to deal with relatively small domains and coarse spatiotemporal scales, additional work is required to develop simulation tools for large-domain analyses, which are more and more common in an increasingly interconnected world. This study proposes a methodological advancement in the so-called CoSMoS framework, which is a flexible simulation framework preserving arbitrary marginal distributions and correlations, to dramatically decrease the computational burden and make the algorithm fast enough to perform large-domain simulations in relatively short time. The proposed approach focuses on correlated processes with mixed (zero-inflated) Uniform marginal distributions. These correlated processes act as intermediates between the target process to simulate (precipitation) and parent Gaussian processes that are the core of the simulation algorithm. Working in the mixed-Uniform space enables us to make a substantial simplification of the so-called correlation transformation functions, which represent a computational bottle neck in the original CoSMoS formulation.

In traditional partial‐differential‐equation (pde)‐based models that treat aquifers as separate compartments, groundwater recharge needs to be defined as a boundary condition or it is a coupling condition to other compartments. Integrated models that treat the vadose and phreatic zones as a continuum allow for a more sophisticated calculation of subsurface fluxes, as feedbacks between both zones are captured. However, they do not contain an explicit groundwater‐recharge term so it needs to be estimated by post‐processing. Groundwater recharge consists of the flux crossing the water table, which can be calculated based on hydraulic gradients, and of changes in groundwater storage. We introduce a method to evaluate the change of groundwater storage by a time‐cumulative water balance over the depth section of water table fluctuations, avoiding the use of a specific yield. We demonstrate the approach first by a simple 1‐D vertical model that does not allow for lateral outflow and illustrates the ambiguity of computing groundwater recharge by different methods. We then apply the approach to a 3‐D model with a complex topography and subsurface structure. The latter example shows that groundwater recharge is highly variable in space and time with notable differences between regional and local estimates. Local heterogeneity of topography or subsurface properties results in complex redistribution patterns of groundwater. In fully integrated models, river‐groundwater exchange flow may severely bias the estimate of groundwater recharge. We therefore advice masking out groundwater recharge at river locations.

We demonstrate a sediment‐index methodology that relates an acoustically‐derived concentration estimate to channel‐average concentration. We compare two different acoustic methods (multifrequency and single frequency) as acoustic index estimators. Between 2012 and 2014 we conducted 25 sampling campaigns where cross‐section, point‐integrated suspended sediment samples, and samples from within the acoustic range were collected. Annual flux was computed for the 3 years using both methods and compared to a more traditional sediment supply to discharge rating‐curve. The most robust method used a single‐frequency inversion where the sum of acoustically‐derived, fractional sand and silt/clay estimates equated the total flux.

High‐frequency monitoring of NO3− mass balance between upstream and downstream measurement sites can quantitatively disentangle multi‐path NO3− uptake dynamics at the reach scale.

With thorough considerations of lateral inputs, the calculated net NO3−‐N uptake rates () differed substantially among campaigns (ranging from −151.1 to 357.6 mg N m2 d−1, with cases of negative values representing net NO3−‐N release), and exhibited higher during the post‐wet season than during the dry season.

This question is tied to the topology of 3D flow paths (termed the Lagrangian kinematics), specifically whether streamlines can undergo braiding motions or can wander freely in the transverse direction. In this study we determine which Darcy flows do admit asymptotic transverse macrodispersion for purely advective transport on the basis of the conductivity structure. We prove that porous media with smooth, locally isotropic hydraulic conductivity exhibit zero transverse macrodispersion under pure advection due to constraints on the Lagrangian kinematics of these flows, whereas either non‐smooth or locally anisotropic conductivity fields can generate transverse macrodispersion. This has implications for upscaling locally isotropic porous media to the block scale as this can result in a locally anisotropic conductivity, leading to non‐zero macrodispersion at the block scale that is spurious in that it does not arise for the fully resolved Darcy scale flow. We also show that conventional numerical methods for computation of particle trajectories do not explicitly preserve the kinematic constraints associated with locally isotropic Darcy flow, and propose a novel psuedo‐symplectic method that does preserve these constraints. These results provide insights into the mechanisms that govern transverse macrodispersion in groundwater flow, and unify seemingly contradictory results in the literature in a coherent framework. These insights call into question the ability of smooth, locally isotropic conductivity fields to represent flow and transport in real heterogeneous porous media.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In recent years there has been vigorous debate whether asymptotic transverse macrodispersion exists in steady three-dimensional (3D) groundwater flows in the purely advective limit.

Even for one‐dimensional morphological models, run times can be up to several days for simulations over multiple decades. Alternatively, analytical tools yield metrics that allow estimation of migration celerity and damping of bed waves, which have potential for being used as rapid assessment tools to explore future morphological developments. We evaluate the use of analytical relations based on linear stability analyses of the St. Venant‐Exner equations, which apply to bed waves with spatial scales much larger than the water depth. With a one‐dimensional numerical morphological model, we assess the validity range of the analytical approach. The comparison shows that the propagation of small bed perturbations is well‐described by the analytical approach. For Froude numbers over 0.3, diffusion becomes important and bed perturbation celerities reduce in time. A spatial‐mode linear stability analysis predicts an upper limit for the bed perturbation celerity. For longer and higher bed perturbations, the dimensions relative to the water depth and the backwater curve length determine whether the analytical approach yields realistic results. For higher bed wave amplitudes, non‐linearity becomes important. For Froude numbers ≤ 0.3, the celerity of bed waves is increasingly underestimated by the analytical approach. The degree of underestimation is proportional to the ratio of bed wave amplitude to water depth and the Froude number. For Froude numbers exceeding 0.3, the net impact on the celerity depends on the balance between the decrease due to damping and the increase due to non‐linear interaction.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Sustainable river management can be supported by models predicting long-term morphological developments.

We evaluate the use of analytical relations based on linear stability analyses of the St. Venant-Exner equations, which apply to bed waves with spatial scales much larger than the water depth. With a one-dimensional numerical morphological model, we assess the validity range of the analytical approach. The comparison shows that the propagation of small bed perturbations is well-described by the analytical approach. For Froude numbers over 0.3, diffusion becomes important and bed perturbation celerities reduce in time. A spatial-mode linear stability analysis predicts an upper limit for the bed perturbation celerity. For longer and higher bed perturbations, the dimensions relative to the water depth and the backwater curve length determine whether the analytical approach yields realistic results. For higher bed wave amplitudes, non-linearity becomes important. For Froude numbers ≤ 0.3, the celerity of bed waves is increasingly underestimated by the analytical approach. The degree of underestimation is proportional to the ratio of bed wave amplitude to water depth and the Froude number. For Froude numbers exceeding 0.3, the net impact on the celerity depends on the balance between the decrease due to damping and the increase due to non-linear interaction.&lt;/p>;</content:encoded><dc:creator> HJ Barneveld, E.

Examples include annual maximum flow, baseflow index and recession shape descriptors. In this paper, we use machine learning (ML) to learn encodings that are optimal ML equivalents of hydrologic signatures, and that are derived directly from the data. We compare the learned signatures to classical signatures, interpret their meaning, and use them to build rainfall‐runoff models in otherwise ungauged watersheds. Our model has an encoder–decoder structure. The encoder is a convolutional neural net mapping historical flow and climate data to a low‐dimensional vector encoding, analogous to hydrological signatures. The decoder structure includes stores and fluxes similar to a classical hydrologic model. For each timestep, the decoder uses current climate data, watershed attributes and the encoding to predict coefficients that distribute precipitation between stores and store outflow coefficients. The model is trained end‐to‐end on the US CAMELS watershed data set to minimize streamflow error. We show that learned signatures can extract new information from streamflow series, because using learned signatures as input to the process‐informed model improves prediction accuracy over benchmark configurations that use classical signatures or no signatures. We interpret learned signatures by correlation with classical signatures, and by using sensitivity analysis to assess their impact on modeled store dynamics. Learned signatures are spatially correlated and relate to streamflow dynamics including seasonality, high and low extremes, baseflow and recessions. We conclude that process‐informed ML models and other applications using hydrologic signatures may benefit from replacing expert‐selected signatures with learned signatures.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Hydrologic signatures are quantitative metrics that describe a streamflow time series.

Evaluating the interannual accuracy during nonobservational periods is a key challenge. This study develops a comprehensive framework to discuss the interannual accuracy of three different TWS reconstructions during 1981–2019, including (a) global‐scale accuracy assessment using GRACE and satellite laser ranging data; (b) regional‐scale accuracy testing across various underlying surfaces (ie, rivers, lakes, and glaciers); and (c) investigation of relevant evidence from other Earth subsystems (ie, historic climate events, sea level budget, and polar motion). Among the three reconstructions, the one that additionally corrects glacial TWS changes (REC2) detects a breaking point in the 1990s and further closes the interannual sea level budget with an absolute difference reduction to 5.13 mm; the reconstruction that is forced by local meteorological conditions (REC1), accounting for 54% of the GRACE‐derived signal energy, underestimates glacial TWS variability but outperforms the other reconstructions in reproducing lake levels, basin‐scale water balances, and climate events at the interannual scale, while the others consider 95%–99% of the GRACE‐derived signal energy. The relatively high accuracy of REC1 (and REC2) in reflecting interannual changes in nonglacial (and glacial) regions is further confirmed by explaining the χ2‐ (and χ1‐) component polar motion. Ten to 20% of the interannual polar motion remains unexplained, indicating room for improvement in interannual TWS reconstruction.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Given the success of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission in mapping terrestrial water storage (TWS) since 2002, recent reconstructions of long-term TWS rely on the use of statistical machine learning to apply GRACE-derived information to past decades.

Past studies have shown that, even when open, a barrier system&#39;s fixed infrastructure can increase estuary stratification and salt intrusion, potentially affecting water quality and ecological processes. However, surge barrier closures could have a much stronger influence on estuary conditions by temporarily blocking the tidal exchange. In this project, we use an existing regional three‐dimensional hydrodynamic model, with modifications to simulate surge barrier closure and reopening, to study the effects on estuarine salt intrusion and stratification of the Hudson River. Across a range of modeled scenarios of gate closure frequencies, durations and river streamflows, we evaluate the changes caused by gate closures, as well as the recovery time to normal conditions. Our results for the Hudson show long‐duration gate closures (three or more days) with low streamflows temporarily lead to salt intrusion and stratification beyond recent historical extremes. Moreover, monthly frequency closures, which could occur as soon as 2070 under realistic scenarios of sea‐level rise and barrier management, do not allow for recovery under low streamflow conditions and could lead to durable changes to estuary physical conditions. As a result, long duration closures and high‐frequency closures both constitute a threat to municipal water supplies. This study demonstrates a framework for understanding the potential impacts of any proposed surge barrier system and can help improve our understanding of corresponding ecological impacts.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Gated storm surge barriers have been constructed or proposed in many estuaries worldwide for coastal flood risk reduction.

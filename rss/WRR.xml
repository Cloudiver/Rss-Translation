To precisely simulate runoff response to climate change in alpine catchments, we took the source region of the Yellow River as a case to develop a physics-informed deep learning (DL) model that tightly hybridizes DL with the physics of dominant hydrological processes, including the neural network-based coupling of soil freeze-thaw physics inspired by the Stefan equation. A physics-informed DL model without soil freeze-thaw representation was also established as a benchmark. Results demonstrated the former model&#39;s superiority in capturing streamflow&#39;s inter-annual dynamics and reproducing baseflow recession properties caused by soil freeze-thaw when average temperature rises by 1°C. This emphasizes the importance of the physics of dominant hydrological processes for DL to make credible runoff projections under rapid climate change. Furthermore, we comprehensively compared the physics-informed DL model with a lumped model, physically-based distributed model, and standard DL model, showing that the physics-informed DL model performs best in simulating streamflow at multi-timescales and the impacts of soil freeze-thaw on runoff, and is more capable of simulating runoff relative change and trend in response to climate change. In summary, our findings demonstrate physics-informed DL&#39;s credibility in runoff projections under drastic climate change when infused with the physics of dominant hydrological processes, and illustrate its superior ability to learn complex hydrological processes, providing a new approach for runoff simulation in permafrost-affected alpine catchments under climate change.&lt;/p>;</content:encoded><dc:creator> Liangjin Zhong, Huimin Lei, Bing Gao</dc:creator><category> Research Article</category><dc:title> Developing a Physics‐informed Deep Learning Model to Simulate Runoff Response to Climate Change in Alpine Catchments</dc:title><dc:identifier> 10.1029/2022WR034118</dc:identifier><prism:publicationname> Water Resources Research</prism:publicationname><prism:doi> 10.1029/2022WR034118</prism:doi><prism:url> https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022WR034118?af=R</prism:url><prism:section> Research Article</prism:section></item><item><link/> https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR034538?af=R<pubDate> Mon, 12 Jun 2023 07:53:38 -0700</pubDate><dc:date> 2023-06-12T07:53:38-07:00</dc:date><source url="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/19447973?af=R"/> Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents <prism:coverdate></prism:coverdate><prism:coverdisplaydate></prism:coverdisplaydate><guid ispermalink="false"> 10.1029/2023WR034538</guid><title> Modeling water flow and solute transport in unsaturated soils using physics‐informed neural networks trained with geoelectrical data</title><description> Water Resources Research, Accepted Article.</description><dc:description> Abstract Accurate modeling of water flow and solute transport in unsaturated soils is of significant importance for precision agriculture, environmental protection and aquifer management.

The difficulties associated with accurately characterizing soil O2 variability have prompted the use of soil moisture as a proxy for O2, as O2 diffusion into soil water is much slower than in soil air. The use of soil moisture alone as a proxy measurement for O2 could result in inaccurate O2 estimations. For example, O2 may remain high during cool months when soil respiration rates are low. We analyzed high‐frequency sensor data (eg, soil moisture, CO2, gas‐phase soil pore O2) with a machine learning technique, the Self‐Organizing Map, to pinpoint suites of soil conditions associated with contrasting O2 regimes. At two riparian sites in northern Vermont, we found that O2 levels varied seasonally, and with soil moisture. For example, forty‐seven percent of low O2 levels were associated with wet and cool soil conditions, whereas 32% were associated with dry and warm conditions. Contrastingly, the majority (62%) of high O2 conditions occurred under dry and warm conditions. High soil moisture levels did not always lead to low O2, as 38% of high O2 values occurred under wet and cool conditions. Our results highlight challenges with predicting soil O2 solely based on water content, as variable combinations of soil and hydrologic conditions can complicate the relationship between water content and O2. This indicates that process‐based ecosystem and denitrification models that rely solely on soil moisture to estimate O2 may need to incorporate other site and climate‐specific drivers to accurately predict soil O2.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Oxygen (O&lt;sub>;2&lt;/sub>;) regulates soil reduction-oxidation processes and therefore modulates biogeochemical cycles.

The recent development of probabilistic large‐domain meteorological datasets enables convenient uncertainty characterization, which however is rarely explored in large‐domain research. This study analyzes how uncertainties in meteorological forcing data affect hydrological modeling in 289 representative cryosphere basins by forcing the Structure for Unifying Multiple Modeling Alternatives (SUMMA) and mizuRoute models with precipitation and air temperature ensembles from the Ensemble Meteorological Dataset for Planet Earth (EM‐Earth). EM‐Earth probabilistic estimates are used in ensemble simulation for uncertainty analysis. The results reveal the magnitude, spatial distribution, and scale effect of uncertainties in meteorological, snow, runoff, soil water, and energy variables. There are three main findings. (1) The uncertainties in precipitation and temperature lead to substantial uncertainties in hydrological model outputs, some of which exceed 100% of the magnitude of the output variables themselves. (2) The uncertainties of different variables show distinct scale effects caused by spatial averaging or temporal averaging. (3) Precipitation uncertainties have the dominant impact for most basins and variables, while air temperature uncertainties are also nonnegligible, sometimes contributing more to modeling uncertainties than precipitation uncertainties. We find that three snow‐related variables (snow water equivalent, snowfall amount, and snowfall fraction) can be used to estimate the impact of air temperature uncertainties for different model output variables. In summary, this study provides insight into the impact of probabilistic datasets on hydrological modeling and quantifies the uncertainties in cryosphere basin modeling that stem from the meteorological forcing data.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Meteorological forcing is a major source of uncertainty in hydrological modeling.

An attempt to assess the temporal fluctuation of ISMR with the long‐distance interaction indicators has been presented here. This also corroborates the argued statement of a weakening relationship between ISMR and ISMI due to significant temporal fluctuation. Monsoon indices: the Indian Summer Monsoon Index (ISMI), East Asian Summer Monsoon Index (EASMI), South Asian Summer Monsoon Index (SASMI), and Western‐North Pacific Monsoon Index (WNPMI) have been studied to create a correlation, coherency, and teleconnection with the ISMR over the Mahanadi River basin (MRB) during 1948–2017. High‐resolution gridded precipitation data were employed to assess the statistical properties of the monsoon and to address the correlation, coherency, and teleconnection with the ISMR. Spearman&#39;s rank‐based correlation test, a non‐parametric Mann‐Kendall trend test, and Sen&#39;s slope have been used to assess the statistical properties of observed precipitation and the monsoon indices. Furthermore, wavelet transform coherence is used to detect transient correlations between ISMR and monsoon indices that have previously been uncorrelated. SASMI (ρ=0.440) dominates ISMI (ρ=0.422) as the most significant and influential long‐distance indicator with ISMR.

Passive microwave remote sensing is a powerful technique for monitoring this timing. We processed low‐frequency microwave time series from the European Space Agency Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission for a set of 31 satellite gauging reaches (SGRs) above 65°N between 2010 and 2020 to determine timing of freeze‐up and break‐up and annual river ice durations. We found indication of progressive ice cover reduction over more than half of the monitored river reaches, with possibly the fastest rate occurring over northeast Russia. Some rivers in high‐latitude North America experienced a slight increase in ice cover. Across the data set, we observed an average 2.2 days shift toward later ice freeze‐up in autumn and an average 0.6 days shift toward earlier ice break‐up in spring, resulting in an average decrease of 3.4 days in ice duration between 2010 and 2020. River reaches with the longest duration of ice cover appeared to have experienced the fastest rate of decrease. A possible reduction of the time lag between air temperature rise or fall and corresponding river ice break‐up and freeze‐up was also observed. Yet results on variability are carefuly interpreted given the short length of the time series (2010–2020) and the low statistical confidence rates calculated for the decadal tendency. Still outcomes are consistent with increases in global and Arctic surface air temperature. Following these time series over the next decade using passive microwave satellite sensors can monitor ice cover duration in the Arctic and will further determine temporal and regional trends.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The timing of ice freeze-up and break-up in the Arctic may be responding to climate change.

Less annual streamflow was generated from annual rainfall during the drought than would have been expected for the same rainfall before the drought. Changes in weather systems, such as cyclones, fronts, and thunderstorms, were also observed during this period. In this study, we assess the role that changes in weather systems played in the RRR shift. We find that catchments that experienced a RRR shift tended to receive less of their rainfall from frontal weather systems, and more of their rainfall from thunderstorm‐enhanced cyclone and cyclone‐front hybrid systems during the drought than catchments that showed little change in RRR. Overall, changes in the proportion of rainfall from weather systems alone explained up to 43% of the variance in the RRR shift between catchments. Including parameters that quantify catchment processes and physiographic features indicated that weather system changes are not the primary indicator of a RRR shift. Catchment mean slope, aridity and valley confinement, together with proportional rainfall change of cyclone‐thunderstorms and cyclone‐front‐thunderstorms, explained 60% of the variance in the RRR shift between catchments. Focusing on streamflow availability, we find the importance of different weather systems and catchment characteristics varies depending on warm or cool season, eastern or western Victoria, and before or during the drought. Following the drought, some catchments largely maintained the RRR shift that occurred during the drought, and also experienced less of their rainfall from fronts and cyclones compared to the other catchments.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Many Victorian catchments experienced a rainfall-runoff relationship (RRR) shift during the Millennium Drought (1997–2009).

However, information on WRT is often missing or outdated, especially in regions lacking lake inflow or outflow observations. Recent advances in global precipitation and evapotranspiration (ET) products and calibration‐free ET models provide the possibility of estimating lake WRT at large scales using estimated runoff from the water balance over the lake catchment. Here, we tested four global ET products and two calibration‐free ET models for estimating the mean annual lake outflow and WRT of 67 globally distributed lakes using precipitation inputs from four global precipitation products. The results show that the WRT estimated using the water balance method and global ET estimates generally correlates well with reference WRT (R = 0.90 ∼ 0.99) when using reliable precipitation inputs and is slightly more accurate than the estimates from the existing global WRT dataset and methods (R = 0.79 ∼ 0.94). Despite the large relative error (RE) in the estimates of the WRT, the RE of the phosphorus retention derived from the estimated WRT is acceptable (RE &lt; ±30%). The simplicity and versatility of this approach underline its potential applications to large‐scale studies that require a fair estimation of WRT.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Water residence time (WRT) is an important lake attribute that influences almost all in-lake nutrient processes. However, information on WRT is often missing or outdated, especially in regions lacking lake inflow or outflow observations. Recent advances in global precipitation and evapotranspiration (ET) products and calibration-free ET models provide the possibility of estimating lake WRT at large scales using estimated runoff from the water balance over the lake catchment. Here, we tested four global ET products and two calibration-free ET models for estimating the mean annual lake outflow and WRT of 67 globally distributed lakes using precipitation inputs from four global precipitation products. The results show that the WRT estimated using the water balance method and global ET estimates generally correlates well with reference WRT (&lt;i>;R&lt;/i>; = 0.90 ∼ 0.99) when using reliable precipitation inputs and is slightly more accurate than the estimates from the existing global WRT dataset and methods (&lt;i>;R&lt;/i>; = 0.79 ∼ 0.94). Despite the large relative error (RE) in the estimates of the WRT, the RE of the phosphorus retention derived from the estimated WRT is acceptable (RE &amp;lt; ±30%). The simplicity and versatility of this approach underline its potential applications to large-scale studies that require a fair estimation of WRT.&lt;/p>;</content:encoded><dc:creator> Kan Ding, Jianming Deng, Boqiang Qin</dc:creator><category> Research Article</category><dc:title> The Potential Use of Global Evapotranspiration Products and Models to Estimate Lake Residence Time at Large Scale</dc:title><dc:identifier> 10.1029/2022WR033148</dc:identifier><prism:publicationname> Water Resources Research</prism:publicationname><prism:doi> 10.1029/2022WR033148</prism:doi><prism:url> https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022WR033148?af=R</prism:url><prism:section> Research Article</prism:section><prism:volume> 59</prism:volume><prism:number> 6个</prism:number></item><item><link/>https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022WR033754?af=R<pubDate> Wed, 07 Jun 2023 10:09:15 -0700</pubDate><dc:date> 2023-06-07T10:09:15-07:00</dc:date><source url="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/19447973?af=R"/> Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents<prism:coverdate> Thu, 01 Jun 2023 00:00:00 -0700</prism:coverdate><prism:coverdisplaydate> Thu, 01 Jun 2023 00:00:00 -0700</prism:coverdisplaydate><guid ispermalink="false"> 10.1029/2022WR033754</guid><title> Transient Bedload Transport During Flashflood Bores in a Desert Gravel‐Bed Channel</title><description> Water Resources Research, Volume 59, Issue 6, June 2023.</description><dc:description> Abstract Evidence of the effect of unsteady flow on bedload sediment transport is meager, particularly in desert rivers, despite its scientific, environmental and engineering importance. Our study of the phenomenon was conducted in Nahal Eshtemoa, Israel, an ephemeral river located in a semi‐arid area and subjected to flash floods. During 4 years, we monitored bedload transport and contemporaneous hydraulics, focusing on two intervals during which flow changed most rapidly: (a) the arrival of flood bores over dry river beds and (b) the propagation of subsequent bores over flowing water. Monitoring involved deployment of plate microphones, video cameras, surface velocity radar and a 3D velocimeter, enabling synchronized and unique data acquisition at high temporal resolution. We hypothesized that turbulence would be considerably elevated during the arrival of a flood bore and that this would induce transient entrainment of bedload. Our results demonstrate that bedload is indeed transported by the bore front and ceases soon after the arrival of most bores, even though water depth continues to rise. Bores arriving on a dry river bed usually generate higher bedload fluxes than bores advancing over flowing water. Elevated values of shear stress, turbulent kinetic energy and water‐surface slope occur as a bore impinges but then decrease. This is likely to be the explanation for high transient rates of bedload transport. Once the threshold depth previously determined as inducing continuous bedload motion is attained (≈40 cm), transport rates rise considerably relative to those associated with the bores.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Evidence of the effect of unsteady flow on bedload sediment transport is meager, particularly in desert rivers, despite its scientific, environmental and engineering importance.

The limited isotopic data across the Himalayan River Basins (HRB) obstructs the study of basin‐scale hydrological processes. New data of stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen from Indus, in combination with a comprehensive compiled data set from HRB, was used for the first time to create isoscapes (δ18O and d‐excess) for specifically representing surface water. The δ18O and d‐excess isoscape define a clear isotopic distinction along a topographic gradient from south to north and west to east that could be reproduced (predicted) by using a Geographically weighted Regression Model (GWRM) based on surface heterogeneity by considering a combination of predictors (precipitation, temperature, evapotranspiration, runoff, elevation, slope, aspect, and land use landcover). The d‐excess isoscape demonstrates more complicated spatial variability, owing to differential moisture inputs from westerlies and the Indian Summer Monsoon, as well as secondary evaporation processes in the region. GWRM isoscapes have been able to compute the fractional contributions from different water sources across HRB. The model‐derived predicted δ18O and elevation values suggest a second‐order polynomial relationship that represents the Isotopic Lapse Rate more accurately than a linear one. The GWRM predictive isoscapes are sufficiently accurate to serve as a good proxy for the influence of moisture source and runoff estimation, palaeoecological studies, climate reconstruction, and changes in hydrological processes because of climate change. Therefore, GWRM can be applied to other regions where data is lacking.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The spatial distribution of water isotopes provides essential scientific data for understanding many hydrological, paleoclimate, and ecological processes.

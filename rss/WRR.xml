The results point out that the reliability of climatological forecasts considerably varies across the 12 methods, particularly in regions with high hydroclimatic variability. One observation is that climatological forecasts tend to deviate from the distributions of observations when there is inadequate flexibility to fit precipitation data. Another observation is that ensemble spreads can be overly wide when there exist overfits of sample‐specific noises in cross validation. Through the tests of global precipitation, the robustness of the log‐sinh transformation and the Bernoulli‐Gamma distribution is highlighted.

Accounting for the skewness and censoring characteristics of hydroclimatic variables, ensemble climatological forecasts can be generated by the log, Box-Cox and log-sinh transformations, by the combinations of the Bernoulli distribution with the Gaussian, Gamma, log-normal, generalized extreme value, generalized logistic and Pearson type III distributions and by the non-parametric resampling, empirical cumulative distribution function and kernel density estimation methods. This paper is concentrated on the reliability of the 12 types of ensemble climatological forecasts. Specifically, mathematical formulations are presented and large-sample tests are devised to verify the forecast reliability for the Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation version 2 across the globe.

In this study, we investigate the impact of pressure pulses that emit waves in the water phase on the water distribution and imbibition patterns in porous media. We present experimental results of water spatial distribution in sand columns following infiltration under abrupt pressured‐water pulses and compare them with those of continuous inflow. Applying pressure waves during infiltration increases pressure gradients behind the wetting front, which can overcome capillary and gravitational forces, leading to uniform imbibition. To simulate the process, we developed a pore‐network model incorporating an analytical solution of pressure wave attenuation to predict the imbibition pattern. Our results demonstrate that the amplitude of the pressure wave is associated with a sharp wetting front, resulting in higher water content compared to Darcy‐type continuous flow.

Clogging of sandy streambeds has previously been studied under losing and gaining flows and during streambed movement, but not when these two flow conditions coincided. We conducted flume experiments to quantify the combined effect of moving bedforms and losing or gaining flows on kaolinite deposition and streambed clogging. The experiments were conducted by adding pulses of kaolinite in a flume packed with sand under a streamwater velocity of 25 cm/s. We measured the deposition rates, dynamics of hyporheic exchange flux (HEF) and vertical hydraulic conductivity (Kv), and the vertical distribution of kaolinite at the end of the experiments under two losing and two gaining flows (Darcy velocity of 10 and 20 cm/day). Kaolinite deposition led to clogging and reduction in Kv and HEF under all flow conditions. Deposition occurred faster under losing flow conditions than under gaining flow conditions. However, the changes in Kv and HEF were similar under losing and gaining flow conditions for similar kaolinite concentrations in the bed. Our results indicate that the deposition patterns of kaolinite were more influenced by bedform movement than by losing or gaining flow conditions, which is markedly different from the behavior observed under losing and gaining conditions for stationary bedforms. This implies that bedform morphodynamics control local‐scale clogging of sandy streambeds and should be accounted for when studying the hydrology of catchments at larger scales.

The relative importance of PFAA retention factors under natural field‐scale conditions remains uncertain, and the historical record of effluent PFAA concentrations is limited. Using soil cores collected from the Penn State Living Filter (irrigated with treated wastewater effluent for nearly 60 years), we evaluated PFAA mass‐balance in the irrigated soils and estimated historical effluent PFAA concentrations. Total accumulated perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) masses measured in soils in 2014 were more than 450 times greater than annual mass loads applied during the 2020 effluent irrigation. Column mass‐balance models reproduced the observed PFOS and PFOA profiles, providing an estimate of historical effluent PFOS and PFOA concentrations: 70‐170 ng L‐1 and 1000‐1300 ng L‐1, respectively. Estimated concentrations were comparable to measurements in other wastewater effluents in the 1990s and 2000s, indicating that wastewater‐irrigated soils can serve as integrated records of historical PFAA loading to the environment. Mass balance calculations suggest that PFOS breakthrough to groundwater occurred 50 years after the start of wastewater irrigation, whereas simulated PFOA breakthrough occurred after only 10 years of irrigation. While wastewater irrigation of soils facilitates retention and reduces effluent PFAA loading to surface waters, resulting PFAA storage in soils potentially creates long‐term sources of PFAAs to groundwater.

Column mass-balance models reproduced the observed PFOS and PFOA profiles, providing an estimate of historical effluent PFOS and PFOA concentrations: 70-170 ng L&lt;sup>;-1&lt;/sup>; and 1000-1300 ng L&lt;sup>;-1&lt;/sup>;, respectively. Estimated concentrations were comparable to measurements in other wastewater effluents in the 1990s and 2000s, indicating that wastewater-irrigated soils can serve as integrated records of historical PFAA loading to the environment. Mass balance calculations suggest that PFOS breakthrough to groundwater occurred 50 years after the start of wastewater irrigation, whereas simulated PFOA breakthrough occurred after only 10 years of irrigation. While wastewater irrigation of soils facilitates retention and reduces effluent PFAA loading to surface waters, resulting PFAA storage in soils potentially creates long-term sources of PFAAs to groundwater.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This article is protected by copyright.

The exacerbated scour that can directly result from LWD accumulations can lead to major structural damage or even catastrophic collapse.

SatVITS‐Flood is based on observations that floods are the primary cause of local vegetation expansion in hyperarid regions. To detect such expansion, we used two time‐series metrics: (a) trend change detection from the Breaks For Additive Season and Trend and (b) a newly developed seasonal change metric based on Temporal Fourier Analysis (TFA) and the growing‐season integral anomaly (TFA‐GSIanom). The two metrics complement each other by capturing changes in perennial plant species following extreme, rare floods and ephemeral vegetation changes following more frequent floods. Metrics were derived from the time series of the normalized difference vegetation index, the modified soil‐adjusted vegetation index, and the normalized difference water index, acquired from MODIS, Landsat, and Advanced Very High‐Resolution Radiometer. The timing of the change was compared with the date of the flood and the magnitude of change with its volume and duration. We tested SatVITS‐Flood in three regions on different continents with 40‐year‐long, systematic, reliable gauge data. Our results indicate that SatVITS‐Flood can predict flood occurrence with an accuracy of 78% and precision of 67% (Recall = 0.69 and F1 = 0.68; p &lt; 0.01), and the flood volume and duration with NSE of 0.79 (RMSE = 15.4 × 106 m3 event−1), and R2 of 0.69 (RMSE = 5.7 days), respectively.

We measured discharge, dissolved oxygen (DO), carbon dioxide (CO2), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) continuously in a persistent pool at the base of a non‐perennial, forested headwater stream in the southeastern United States to characterize how flow changes affect carbon emissions and export as the stream expands and shrinks. We also compared carbon concentrations and export during different stream flow categories before and after fall wet‐up. CO2 concentrations were high when discharge was lowest (median = 10.2 mg L‐1) and low during high flows (3.2 mg L‐1) and storms (1.1 mg L‐1). High CO2 concentrations led to high emissions on a per area basis during low flow times, but whole‐channel stream CO2 emissions were limited by the small surface area of the stream during periods of surface water disconnection. DOC concentration varied by season (range = 0.1 ‐ 16.2 mg L‐1) with large pulses during smaller summer storms. We found that CO2 and DOC concentrations differed among binned stages of stream flow.

We examined how watershed topography and streambed hydraulic conductivity impact groundwater age and stream discharge at eight sites along a headwater stream within the Manitou Experimental Forest, CO USA. To do so, we measured: 1) continuous stream and groundwater discharge/level and specific conductivity from April to November, 2021; 2) biweekly stream and groundwater chemistry; 3) groundwater chlorofluorocarbons and tritium in spring and fall; 4) streambed hydraulic conductivity; and 5) local slope.

We then combined chlorofluorocarbon and tritium data to estimate the age composition of riparian groundwater. Our data suggest that future stream drying is more probable where local slope is steep and streambed hydraulic conductivity is high. In these areas, groundwater source shifted seasonally, as indicated by age increases, and we observed a high fraction of groundwater in streamflow, primarily interflow from adjacent hillslopes. In contrast, where local slope is flat and streambed hydraulic conductivity is low, streamflow is more likely to persist as groundwater age was seasonally constant and buffered by storage in alluvial sediments.

However, observational techniques do not produce adequately accurate spatial‐temporal continuous regional soil moisture data. The data assimilation method can be used to improve the soil moisture estimations by merging multi‐source observed data, but its performance is affected by error covariance and the quality of assimilated data. We designed eight numerical experiments to analyze how to improve the filter performance through soil moisture assimilation using the unscented weighted ensemble Kalman filter (UWEnKF) and 1‐D Richards equation at Maqu and Erlinghu (ELH) observational sites in the source region of Yellow River (SRYR), China. The experimental results show that the filter performance improves as the quality of assimilated data increases in the soil moisture assimilation experiment when assimilating in‐situ surface soil moisture (SSM) observations, SMAP SSM data and downscaled SMAP SSM data. In other aspects, filter performance is readily affected by model and observation error covariances in soil moisture assimilation. If the SMAP SSM data are taken to be perfect (ie, small bias), UWEnKF performs differently between different sites because of the underestimation or overestimation of SMAP SSM and model simulations compared to the in‐situ observations. Additionally, different soil moisture assimilation results can be obtained with different initial values at the beginning of the assimilation period. Overall, filter performance can be improved primarily by improving the quality of assimilated data (eg, downscaling the remote sensing data), and by creating a reasonable and effective method for determining error covariance.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Highly accurate soil moisture information is necessary to understand land surface processes. However, observational techniques do not produce adequately accurate spatial-temporal continuous regional soil moisture data. The data assimilation method can be used to improve the soil moisture estimations by merging multi-source observed data, but its performance is affected by error covariance and the quality of assimilated data. We designed eight numerical experiments to analyze how to improve the filter performance through soil moisture assimilation using the unscented weighted ensemble Kalman filter (UWEnKF) and 1-D Richards equation at Maqu and Erlinghu (ELH) observational sites in the source region of Yellow River (SRYR), China. The experimental results show that the filter performance improves as the quality of assimilated data increases in the soil moisture assimilation experiment when assimilating in-situ surface soil moisture (SSM) observations, SMAP SSM data and downscaled SMAP SSM data. In other aspects, filter performance is readily affected by model and observation error covariances in soil moisture assimilation.

In this study, a scalar transport model for the flow with flexible submerged vegetation is developed. The turbulent structure and scalar transport characteristics in the flow without vegetation, and with rigid and flexible vegetation are compared. The results show that the scalar diffusion in the flow is mainly governed by the turbulent diffusion outside the diffusion boundary layer. The wake flow downstream of rigid vegetation and the small‐scale Kelvin–Helmholtz (KH) vortices near the top of the canopy are the main reasons to enhance the turbulence intensity in the flow and to significantly increase the turbulence diffusion of scalars. However, the flexible vegetation movement induces the large‐scale KH vortices near the top of the canopy. It also causes to increase the turbulence intensity in the flow, to redistribute the scalar concentration in a wide range, to increase the scalar concentration across the flow depth, and to increase the scalar turbulence diffusion intensity. In the flow with rigid vegetation, the values of the turbulent Schmidt number vary from 0.72 to 1.93 below the top of the canopy, while in the flow with flexible vegetation, they vary from 0.58 to 1.99 only near the top of the canopy. Above the top of the canopy, the Schmidt number ranges from 0.48 to 0.84. The results are useful for the parameterization of scalar transport in natural vegetated rivers.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Scalar transport in vegetated flow plays an important role in natural river ecology.

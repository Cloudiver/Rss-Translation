&lt;p>;近20亿人依赖亚洲水塔提供的淡水，但在这个环境恶劣、观测资料稀缺的高山地区，长期径流估算具有挑战性。大多数水文模型依靠观测到的径流进行校准，并且在亚洲水塔测量不佳的情况下适用性有限。为了克服这些限制，我们在这里提出了一种新的数据驱动模型 SM2R（土壤水分径流），使用再分析强迫数据模拟基于土壤水分动态的月径流。 The SM2R model was applied and examined in 20 drainage basins across seven Asian water towers during the past four decades of 1981‒2020. Without invoking any observations for calibration, the overall good performance of SM2R-derived runoff (correlation coefficient ≥ 0.74 and normalized root mean square error ≤ 0.22 compared to observed runoff at 20 gauges) suggests considerable potential for runoff simulation in poorly gauged basins. Even though the SM2R model is forced by ERA5-Land (ERA5L) reanalysis data, it largely outperforms the ERA5L-estimated runoff across the seven Asian water towers, particularly in basins with widely distributed glaciers and frozen soil. The SM2R approach is highly promising for constraining hydrologic variables from soil moisture information. Our results provide valuable insights for not only long-term runoff estimation over key Asian basins, but also understanding hydrologic processes across poorly gauged regions globally.&lt;/p>;</content:encoded><dc:creator> Xueying Li, Di Long, Louise J.

However, most existing budget closure correction methods (BCCs) are significantly affected by errors in the budget‐component products. Moreover, these existing BCCs do not fully account for the preselection of high‐precision input data sets before enforcing the water budget closure, resulting in uncertainties in the budget‐corrected data sets. In this study, a two‐step method was proposed to enforce the water budget closure of satellite‐based hydrological products. First, high‐precision budget‐component data sets were selected and second, the water budget closure of the selected high‐precision data sets was then enforced by proposing an improved BCC strategy, that is, the Minimized Series Deviation method (MSD). The performance of the proposed two‐step method was verified in 24 global basins by comparing it to three existing BCCs of varying complexity, that is, Proportional Redistribution (PR), Constrained Kalman Filter (CKF), and Multiple Collocation (MCL). The results showed that compared to the existing BCCs, the proposed two‐step method significantly improved the accuracy of budget‐corrected data sets in the range of 2%–19% (statistical analysis was based root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) with estimated observation (EO) as a reference). This study also summarized the main factors influencing the performance of the existing BCCs and their further development prospects based on the results.

The results showed that compared to the existing BCCs, the proposed two-step method significantly improved the accuracy of budget-corrected data sets in the range of 2%–19% (statistical analysis was based root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) with estimated observation (EO) as a reference). This study also summarized the main factors influencing the performance of the existing BCCs and their further development prospects based on the results. This provides insight into the expansion of theories and methods related to closing the terrestrial water budget.&lt;/p>;</content:encoded><dc:creator> Zengliang Luo, Huan Li, Sihan Zhang, Lunche Wang, Shaoqiang Wang, Lizhe Wang</dc:creator><category> Research Article</category><dc:title> A Novel Two‐Step Method for Enforcing Water Budget Closure and an Intercomparison of Budget Closure Correction Methods Based on Satellite Hydrological Products</dc:title><dc:identifier> 10.1029/2022WR032176</dc:identifier><prism:publicationname> Water Resources Research</prism:publicationname><prism:doi> 10.1029/2022WR032176</prism:doi><prism:url> https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022WR032176?af=R</prism:url><prism:section> Research Article</prism:section><prism:volume> 59</prism:volume><prism:number> 3</prism:number></item><item><link/> https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022WR034062?af=R<pubDate> Wed, 08 Mar 2023 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate><dc:date> 2023-03-08T12:00:00-08:00</dc:date><source url="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/19447973?af=R"/> Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents<prism:coverdate> Wed, 01 Mar 2023 00:00:00 -0800</prism:coverdate><prism:coverdisplaydate> Wed, 01 Mar 2023 00:00:00 -0800</prism:coverdisplaydate><guid ispermalink="false"> 10.1029/2022WR034062</guid><title> A Network‐Scale Modeling Framework for Stream Metabolism, Ecosystem Efficiency, and Their Response to Climate Change</title><description> Water Resources Research, Volume 59, Issue 3, March 2023.</description><dc:description> Abstract Climate change and the predicted warmer temperatures and more extreme hydrological regimes could affect freshwater ecosystems and their energy pathways. To appreciate the complex spatial and temporal interactions of carbon cycling in flowing waters, ecosystem metabolism (gross primary production [GPP] and ecosystem respiration [ER]) must be resolved at the scale of an entire river network. Here, we propose a meta‐ecosystem framework that couples light and temperature regimes with a reach‐scale ecosystem model and integrates network structure, catchment land cover, and the hydrologic regime. The model simulates the distributed functioning of dissolved and particulate organic carbon, autotrophic biomass, and thus ecosystem metabolism, and reproduces fairly well the metabolic regimes observed in 12 reaches of the Ybbs River network, Austria. Results show that the annual network–scale metabolism was heterotrophic, yet with a clear peak of autotrophy in spring. Autochthonous energy sources contributed 43% of the total ER. We further investigated the effect of altered thermal and hydrologic regimes on metabolism and ecosystem efficiency. We predicted that an increase of 2.5°C in average stream water temperature could boost ER and GPP by 31% (24%–57%) and 28% (5%–57%), respectively. The effect of flashier hydrologic regimes is more complex and depends on autotrophic biomass density. The analysis shows the complex interactions between environmental conditions and biota in shaping stream metabolism and highlights the existing knowledge gaps for reliable predictions of the effects of climate change in these ecosystems.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Climate change and the predicted warmer temperatures and more extreme hydrological regimes could affect freshwater ecosystems and their energy pathways.

However, observations of near‐surface wind are typically spatially sparse. The use of these sparse wind fields to force distributed models, such as hydrological models, is greatly complicated in complex terrain, such as mountain headwaters basins. In these regions, wind flows are heavily impacted by overlapping influences of terrain at different scales. This can have a great impact on calculations of evapotranspiration, snowmelt, and blowing snow transport and sublimation. The use of high‐resolution atmospheric models allows for numerical weather prediction (NWP) model outputs to be dynamically downscaled. However, the computation burden for large spatial extents and long periods of time often precludes their use. Here, a wind‐library approach is presented to aid in downscaling NWP outputs and terrain‐correcting spatially interpolated observations. This approach preserves important spatial characteristics of the flow field at a fraction of the computational costs of even the simplest high‐resolution atmospheric models. This approach improves on previous implementations by: scaling to large spatial extents O(1M km2); approximating lee‐side effects; and fully automating the creation of the wind library. Overall, this approach was shown to have a 3rd quartile RMSE of 1.8 m ⋅ s−1 and a 3rd quartile RMSE of 58.2° versus a standalone diagnostic windflow model. The wind velocity estimates versus observations were better than existing empirical terrain‐based estimates and computational savings were approximately 100‐fold versus the diagnostic model.

Radon (222Rn) has been widely used as a natural geochemical tracer to quantify SGD, but field measurements are time consuming and costly. Here, we use deep learning to predict coastal seawater radon in SGD‐impacted regions. We hypothesize that deep learning could resolve radon trends and enable preliminary insights with limited field observations of groundwater tracers. Two deep learning models were trained on global coastal seawater radon observations (n = 39,238) with widely available inputs (eg, salinity, temperature, water depth). The first model used a one‐dimensional convolutional neural network (1D‐CNN‐RNN) framework for site‐specific gap filling and producing short‐term future predictions. A second model applied a fully connected neural network (FCNN) framework to predict radon across geographically and hydrologically diverse settings. Both models can predict observed radon concentrations with r2 >; 0.76. Specifically, the FCNN model offers a compelling development because synthetic radon tracer datasets can be obtained using only basic water quality and meteorological parameters. This opens opportunities to attain radon data from regions with large data gaps, such as the Global South and other remote locations, allowing for insights that can be used to predict SGD and plan field experiments. Overall, we demonstrate how field‐based measurements combined with big‐data approaches such as deep learning can be utilized to assess radon and potentially SGD beyond local scales.

The investment cost has been estimated as 169,278 € with a payback period of almost 4.2 irrigation seasons. According to the solution, the effective amount of produced energy is equal to 289 MWh if the system is properly regulated and the pressure exceeding the minimum requirements is exploited to produce energy.

We present two alternatives to the two‐source evapotranspiration (ET) model, which utilize a more accurate approximation of the Clausius‐Clapeyron relation. Model performance was evaluated through a comparison with observed half‐hourly eddy covariance fluxes. Modeled representations of sensible heat dynamics and the limiting behaviors were also evaluated to identify the causes of model inaccuracies. Our analysis shows that the new exponential approximation used here significantly reduces errors that stem from solutions to the energy balance equations. The proposed parallel and series models are both more accurate than the Shuttleworth‐Wallace (SW) model under the conditions evaluated here, but we cannot conclude that the new models are consistently more accurate over a broader range of conditions. The new models can correctly reproduce several theoretical limiting behaviors, whereas the SW model generates conceptually incorrect results for several important limiting cases in which some key conductances approach both zero and infinity. Importantly, these models seriously underestimate the observed latent heat fluxes at night; the major causes of the nighttime model inadequacies are thought to be uncertainties of the estimated conductances and forcing data errors. The central concepts and processes related to new models are described via plots of temperature versus specific humidity to explore the theory behind an ET model. Through these efforts, we anticipate making more reliable ET predictions that will lead to a complete understanding of vegetation–atmosphere interactions.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Environmental models are sensitive to inaccuracies in their approximation algorithms, which can bias model simulations and even lead to incorrect concepts.

The central concepts and processes related to new models are described via plots of temperature versus specific humidity to explore the theory behind an ET model. Through these efforts, we anticipate making more reliable ET predictions that will lead to a complete understanding of vegetation–atmosphere interactions.&lt;/p>;</content:encoded><dc:creator> Guoxiao Wei, Zijing Zhao, Wei Tian, Zhongqi Qiu, Zewei Yang, Fubing Wang</dc:creator><category> Research Article</category><dc:title> Two Alternatives to the Two‐Source Energy Balance Evapotranspiration Model</dc:title><dc:identifier> 10.1029/2022WR032958</dc:identifier><prism:publicationname> Water Resources Research</prism:publicationname><prism:doi> 10.1029/2022WR032958</prism:doi><prism:url> https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022WR032958?af=R</prism:url><prism:section> Research Article</prism:section><prism:volume> 59</prism:volume><prism:number> 3</prism:number></item><item><link/> https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022WR033026?af=R<pubDate> Tue, 07 Mar 2023 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate><dc:date> 2023-03-07T12:00:00-08:00</dc:date><source url="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/19447973?af=R"/> Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents<prism:coverdate> Wed, 01 Mar 2023 00:00:00 -0800</prism:coverdate><prism:coverdisplaydate> Wed, 01 Mar 2023 00:00:00 -0800</prism:coverdisplaydate><guid ispermalink="false"> 10.1029/2022WR033026</guid><title> Toward Improved Parameterizations of Reservoir Operation in Ungauged Basins: A Synergistic Framework Coupling Satellite Remote Sensing, Hydrologic Modeling, and Conceptual Operation Schemes</title><description> Water Resources Research, Volume 59, Issue 3, March 2023.</description><dc:description> Abstract Assessments of water and energy security over historical and future periods require hydrologic models that can accurately simulate reservoir operations. However, scare reservoir operation data limits the accuracy of current reservoir representations in simulating reservoir behaviors. Furthermore, the reliability of these representations under changing inflow regimes remains unclear, which makes their application for long future planning horizons questionable. To this end, we propose a synergistic framework to predict the release, storage, and hydropower production of ungauged reservoirs (ie, reservoirs without in‐situ inflow, release, storage, and operating rules) by combining remotely sensed reservoir operating patterns and model‐simulated reservoir inflow with conceptual reservoir operation schemes within a land surface‐hydrologic model. A previously developed reservoir operation scheme is extended with a storage anomaly based calibration approach to accommodate the relatively short time series and large time intervals of remotely sensed data. By setting up controlled experiments in the Yalong River Basin in China, we show that remote sensing can improve the parameter estimation and simulations of ungauged reservoirs for all selected reservoir operation schemes, thereby improving the downstream flood and streamflow simulations. However, most of these schemes show degraded accuracies of reservoir operation simulations under a changing inflow regime, which could lead to unreliable assessments of future water resources and hydropower production. In comparison, our newly extended reservoir operation scheme can be more adaptable to flow regime variations. Our study provides a practical framework for reservoir impact assessments and predictions with the ongoing satellite altimetry projects such as Surface Water and Ocean Topography.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Assessments of water and energy security over historical and future periods require hydrologic models that can accurately simulate reservoir operations.

However, while existing stochastic simulation methods are mature enough to deal with relatively small domains and coarse spatiotemporal scales, additional work is required to develop simulation tools for large‐domain analyses, which are more and more common in an increasingly interconnected world. This study proposes a methodological advancement in the so‐called CoSMoS framework, which is a flexible simulation framework preserving arbitrary marginal distributions and correlations, to dramatically decrease the computational burden and make the algorithm fast enough to perform large‐domain simulations in relatively short time. The proposed approach focuses on correlated processes with mixed (zero‐inflated) Uniform marginal distributions. These correlated processes act as intermediates between the target process to simulate (precipitation) and parent Gaussian processes that are the core of the simulation algorithm. Working in the mixed‐Uniform space enables us to make a substantial simplification of the so‐called correlation transformation functions, which represent a computational bottle neck in the original CoSMoS formulation. As a proof of concept, we simulate 40 years of daily precipitation records from 1000 gauging stations in the Mississippi River basin. Moreover, we extend CoSMoS incorporating parent non‐Gaussian processes with different degrees of tail dependence and suggest potential improvements including the separate simulation of occurrence and intensity processes, advection, anisotropy, and nonstationary spatiotemporal correlation functions.

This study presents a burst detection methodology applying Bayesian dynamic linear models (DLM) on water flow time series combined with an outlier monitoring tool. The model is used to characterize the actual flow and, for each time, a one‐step ahead forecast distribution is obtained recursively before moving onto the next observation. The outlier detection method consists of comparing the main model with an alternative one wherein the mean flow is shifted to a higher value (as bursts tend to increase flow) to evaluate which model best fit the observed data. If the alternative model is favored, a burst alarm is issued. To verify the performance of this approach, the DLM and monitoring tool were applied on two years of flow data from two district meter areas (DMAs) in Halifax (Canada), and a historical break dataset is used to assess model accuracy. The model was able to detect up to 75% and 71.2% of the pipe breaks, with a false alarm rate of 5.15% and 12% in the first and second DMA, respectively. Finally, the proposed model allows for straightforward interpretation of model parameters, nonlinear relationship between flow and predictors of interest, naturally describes the uncertainty for future predictions, can easily accommodate missing values and can be tuned to maximize break detection or minimize false alarm rates to adapt to specific objectives of water infrastructure managers.

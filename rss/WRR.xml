This approach improves on previous implementations by: scaling to large spatial extents O(1M km2); approximating lee‐side effects; and fully automating the creation of the wind library. Overall, this approach was shown to have a third quartile RMSE of 1.8 and a third quartile RMSE of 58.2° versus a standalone diagnostic windflow model. The wind velocity estimates versus observations were better than existing empirical terrain‐based estimates and computational savings were approximately 100‐fold versus the diagnostic model.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Estimates of near-surface wind speed and direction are key meteorological components for predicting many surface hydrometeorological processes that influence critical aspects of hydrological and biological systems. However, observations of near-surface wind are typically spatially sparse. The use of these sparse wind fields to force distributed models, such as hydrological models, is greatly complicated in complex terrain, such as mountain headwaters basins. In these regions, wind flows are heavily impacted by overlapping influences of terrain at different scales. This can have a great impact on calculations of evapotranspiration, snowmelt, and blowing snow transport and sublimation. The use of high-resolution atmospheric models allows for numerical weather prediction (NWP) model outputs to be dynamically downscaled. However, the computation burden for large spatial extents and long periods of time often precludes their use. Here, a wind-library approach is presented to aid in downscaling NWP outputs and terrain-correcting spatially interpolated observations. This approach preserves important spatial characteristics of the flow field at a fraction of the computational costs of even the simplest high-resolution atmospheric models. This approach improves on previous implementations by: scaling to large spatial extents O(1M km&lt;sup>;2&lt;/sup>;); approximating lee-side effects; and fully automating the creation of the wind library.

Even for one‐dimensional morphological models, run times can be up to several days for simulations over multiple decades. Alternatively, analytical tools yield metrics that allow estimation of migration celerity and damping of bed waves, which have potential for being used as rapid assessment tools to explore future morphological developments. We evaluate the use of analytical relations based on linear stability analyses of the St. Venant‐Exner equations, which apply to bed waves with spatial scales much larger than the water depth. With a one‐dimensional numerical morphological model, we assess the validity range of the analytical approach. The comparison shows that the propagation of small bed perturbations is well‐described by the analytical approach. For Froude numbers over 0.3, diffusion becomes important and bed perturbation celerities reduce in time. A spatial‐mode linear stability analysis predicts an upper limit for the bed perturbation celerity. For longer and higher bed perturbations, the dimensions relative to the water depth and the backwater curve length determine whether the analytical approach yields realistic results. For higher bed wave amplitudes, non‐linearity becomes important. For Froude numbers ≤0.3, the celerity of bed waves is increasingly underestimated by the analytical approach. The degree of underestimation is proportional to the ratio of bed wave amplitude to water depth and the Froude number. For Froude numbers exceeding 0.3, the net impact on the celerity depends on the balance between the decrease due to damping and the increase due to non‐linear interaction.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Sustainable river management can be supported by models predicting long-term morphological developments.

Drought forecasting efforts have often been conducted and evaluated at coarse spatial resolutions (ie, >;10‐km), which miss key local drought information at higher resolutions. Addressing the importance of forecasting drought at high resolutions, this study develops statistical models to evaluate 1‐ to 3‐month lead time predictability of meteorological and agricultural summer drought across the western US at a 4‐km resolution. Our high‐resolution drought predictions have statistically significant skill (p ≤ 0.05) across 70‐100% of the western US, varying by evaluation metric and lead time. 1‐ to 3‐month lead time drought forecasts accurately represent monitored summer drought spatial patterns during major drought events, the interannual variability of drought area from 1982‐2020 (r = 0.84‐0.93), and drought trends (r=0.94‐0.97). 71% of western US summer drought area interannual variability can be explained by cold‐season (November‐February) climate conditions alone allowing skillful 3‐month lead time predictions. Pre‐summer drought conditions (represented by drought indices) are the most important predictors for summer drought. Thus, the statistical models developed in this study heavily rely on the autocorrelation of chosen agricultural and meteorological drought indices which estimate land surface moisture memory. Indeed, prediction skill strongly correlates with persistence of drought conditions (r ≥ 0.73). This study is intended to support future development of operational drought early warning systems that inform drought management.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Drought monitoring and forecasting systems are used in the United States (US) to inform drought management decisions.

Thus, understanding their interaction with and transport through materials is important. We examine the impact of nanoparticle hydrophobicity and porous medium surface area on the transport of carbon nanoparticles through sand‐packed columns under saturated and unsaturated conditions. The fluorescent carbon nanoparticles (FCNs) used in this study, synthesized from citric acid and ethanolamine, exhibit synthesis‐temperature‐dependent hydrophobicity. To quantify the impact of hydrophobicity on retention, we use FCNs synthesized at four temperatures: 190˚C (FCN190), 210˚C (FCN210), 230˚C (FCN230), and 250˚C (FCN250). Several observations are noted. First, the more hydrophobic particles (FCN230 and FCN250) attain lower outlet concentrations and mass recovery than more hydrophilic particles (FCN190 and FCN210). For instance, while 77% of the FCN190 was recovered after passing through a fine‐sand packed column, only 23% of the FCN250 was recovered. Second, sand surface area significantly impacts FCN recovery. A 17‐fold increase in sand surface area yields a 30% decrease in the recovery of FCN210. Third, no significant difference in the mass recovery of the FCNs was observed between the unsaturated and saturated conditions, which is attributed to the small size of the FCNs relative to the water film thickness surrounding sand grains. Fourth, the particle transport model in HYDRUS‐1D successfully simulated FCN transport, showing approximately a 10‐fold increase in the attachment coefficient for hydrophobic FCNs. In summary, through experiments and modeling, we show that hydrophobicity is a major factor impacting FCN transport. This article is protected by copyright.

Many efforts have been devoted in the past decades to developing models to describe soil water retention curves.

The SM reconstruction, which explained 60.9% of the actual variance, revealed that an abrupt wet‐to‐dry change occurred in 1884.

In particular, the variability in SM reached an unprecedented level after the 1950s relative to that during the past three centuries. A structural equation model and running correlation analysis revealed that SM variation was mainly controlled by precipitation rather than temperature. This indicates that the anthropogenic‐related weakening of the Indian summer monsoon played a more dominant role in SM changes after 1884 than the increase in temperature. If the SM variability is to be further increased in the future, it may undermine ecosystem stability and forest health.

One reason for the failure of these efforts appears to be that models used for watershed P management have understated and misrepresented the role of in‐stream processes in shaping watershed P export. Here, we update the latest release of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT+), a widely used watershed management model, to better represent in‐stream P retention and remobilization (SWAT+PR&amp;R). We add new streambed pools where P is stored and tracked, and we incorporate three new processes driving in‐stream P dynamics: (1) deposition and resuspension of sediment‐associated P, (2) diffusion of dissolved P between the water column and streambed, and (3) adsorption and desorption of mineral P. The objective of this modeling work is to provide a diagnostic tool that enables researchers to challenge existing assumptions regarding how watersheds store, transform, and transport P. Here, in a first diagnostic analysis, SWAT+PR&amp;R helps reconcile in‐stream P retention theory (that P is retained at low flows and remobilized at high flows) and a discordant dataset in our validation watershed. SWAT+PR&amp;R results (1) clarify that the theorized relationship between P retention and flow is only valid (for this point‐source affected testbed, at least) at the temporal scale of a single rising‐or‐falling hydrograph limb and (2) illustrate that hysteresis obscures the relationship at longer temporal scales. Future work using SWAT+PR&amp;R could further challenge assumptions regarding timescales of in‐stream P legacies and sources of P load variability. This article is protected by copyright.

The introduction of O2 and CO2 efficiently stimulated U mobilization in the mining aquifer. The injected CO2 critically promoted the dissolution of carbonate minerals, which enhanced the formation of uranyl carbonate (predominantly CaUO2(CO3)22‐ and Ca2UO2(CO3)3(aq)) and thus facilitated U mobility. Generally, δ34SSO4 and δ18OSO4 in M2 and M1 were significantly lower than those in GC (p &lt; 0.01). A Bayesian isotope mixing model of δ34SSO4 and δ18OSO4 showed that the contribution of pyrite oxidation to SO42‐ concentration increased from 1.7% in GC to 13.6% in M2 and to 15.0% in M1. During ISL, pyrite, ammonium, and dissolved organic carbon were major compounds competing with U(IV) for introduced O2 in the ore‐bearing aquifer. Most of the consumed O2 was used for pyrite oxidation (56.2%) and U(IV) oxidation (39.3%), following the thermodynamic sequence of those redox reactions.

This study analyzed the citation records of the top 10 journals from 2002 through 2021 for the last two decades. Important to note, there are inconsistencies in the Web of Science database. Contradictory to many fields, few papers are uncited. However, the Simpson paradox applies. More specifically, on the one hand, the correlation between citations to papers 7 years post publication and 1 or 2 years post publication (which determine the IF) has increased, which supports this metric. On the other hand, many of the most highly cited papers at the time of the IF calculation are lowly cited 5 years afterward. Additionally, most currently very highly cited papers were relatively uncited when they were used in the IF calculation. This raises doubt about the usefulness of this metric. For a limited number of journals, papers from individual nations strongly influence the IF. Also, for a few journals, the IFs are strongly influenced by review papers, but leaving these out of the IF does change the top 3 and 10 of the rankings. The general conclusion is that IFs do contain some valuable information about the journals&#39; citation impact, but that using them to rank journals is questionable practice.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Despite regularly being criticized, the Impact Factor (IF) remains a widely used journal analysis metric.

To this end, we here employed a coupled liquid‒vapor‒heat‒airflow STEMMUS (simultaneous transfer of energy, mass, and momentum in unsaturated soil) model to investigate the impact of extreme precipitation, at both event and annual scales, on CZ hydrological processes within a semiarid loess site vegetated by apple trees on China&#39;s Loess Plateau. At the event scale, the vapor flux was two orders of magnitude lower than the liquid water flux. However, the thermal vapor flux penetrated to depths of 200 cm, whereas the isothermal liquid water flux only infiltrated to 100 cm during the study period, implying that thermal‐gradient‐driven vapor transfer is an important mechanism for deep‐layer recharge (DLR). At the annual scale, the DLR below 200 cm during extremely wet years was 6.5 times larger than that during extremely dry years. In contrast, extreme changes in climate had only limited impacts on evapotranspiration; the difference between extremely wet and extremely dry years averaged only 35 mm, much less than the difference in precipitation, which averaged 310 mm. However, the extremely dry years showed a higher ratio (0.58) between transpiration and evapotranspiration than did the extremely wet years (0.51). The findings reported here improve our understanding of CZ hydrological processes related to precipitation extremes in semiarid loess regions.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;The extent and mechanisms by which precipitation extremes affect hydrological processes in the critical zone (CZ) of loess possessing a thick unsaturated zone remains poorly understood.

&lt;p>;植物蒸腾过程中的水分年龄揭示了土壤-植物-大气连续体中水分动态的重要过程，该过程受降水输入和根区水分变化和有效性的调节。 However, the impacts of climate patterns and rooting depth on water age dynamics in transpiration are inadequately investigated. In this study, variations in root-zone water replenishment are estimated based on stable isotope compositions of precipitation and plant xylem water, and a piecewise linear mixing water age model is employed to quantify water ages in plant transpiration under five different climates. The results show that water ages in transpiration are very dynamic in all climates with a range between 1 and 229 days. Water replenishments in the root-zone reveal whether and how much precipitation enters the root zone. Climate patterns control median (mean) water age in plant transpiration but modified by rooting depth. In wet climates, plants mainly rely on water source that originates from precipitation in the current month (accounting for about 60% on average of their water sources), while plants in dry climates largely rely on water source that originates from precipitation fallen on previous months/seasons. These indicate that climate has profound impacts on plant water source by regulating precipitation inputs, root zone water storage and residence time, and evapotranspiration. Despite the limitations of this study, our study provides an alternative way to reveal the precipitation partitioning in root-zone and seasonal changes in plant water use of precipitation, which highlights different vegetation responses to water variability between climate types.&lt;/p>;</content:encoded><dc:creator> Zidong Luo, Yunpeng Nie, Hongsong Chen, Huade Guan, Xinping Zhang, Kelin Wang</dc:creator><category> Research Article</category><dc:title> Water Age Dynamics in Plant Transpiration: The Effects of Climate Patterns and Rooting Depth</dc:title><dc:identifier> 10.1029/2022WR033566</dc:identifier><prism:publicationname> Water Resources Research</prism:publicationname><prism:doi> 10.1029/2022WR033566</prism:doi><prism:url> https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022WR033566?af=R</prism:url><prism:section> Research Article</prism:section><prism:volume> 59</prism:volume><prism:number> 4个</prism:number></item><item><link/>https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022WR034041?af=R<pubDate> Mon, 24 Apr 2023 08:25:44 -0700</pubDate><dc:date> 2023-04-24T08:25:44-07:00</dc:date><source url="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/19447973?af=R"/> Wiley: Water Resources Research: Table of Contents<prism:coverdate> Sat, 01 Apr 2023 00:00:00 -0700</prism:coverdate><prism:coverdisplaydate> Sat, 01 Apr 2023 00:00:00 -0700</prism:coverdisplaydate><guid ispermalink="false"> 10.1029/2022WR034041</guid><title> Diffusive‐Dispersive Isotope Fractionation of Chlorinated Ethenes in Groundwater: The Key Role of Incomplete Mixing and Its Multi‐Scale Effects</title><description> Water Resources Research, Volume 59, Issue 4, April 2023.</description><dc:description> Abstract Diffusive‐dispersive processes are ubiquitous in porous media with important implications for solute transport in many natural and engineered systems; however, their effects on isotope fractionation of organic contaminants in subsurface flow‐through systems is not well understood.

However, these coupled processes are rarely documented through high‐resolution measurements focused on water‐carbon interactions. We collated a state‐of‐the‐art high‐frequency dataset throughout a snowmelt and early post snowmelt period, alongside regular samples of stream water, precipitation, and snowmelt isotopes (δ18O). Our study was conducted during the 2019 snowmelt and initial post snowmelt season in a subarctic, peatland influenced headwater catchment in Pallas, Northern Finland. We measured high‐frequency dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and in‐stream carbon dioxide (pCO2). We identified a change in hydrological processes as the snowmelt season progressed and the post snowmelt season began. We found a) Overland flow dominated stream DOC dynamics in early snowmelt, while increased catchment connectivity opened new distal pathways in the later snowmelt period; b) CO2 processes were initially driven by rapid bursts of CO2 from the meltwaters in snowmelt, followed by dilution and source limitation emerging post snowmelt as deep soil pathways replaced the snowpack as the main source of CO2; c) stream carbon concentration shifted from being relatively balanced between CO2 and DOC during the early snowmelt period to being increasingly DOC dominated as snowmelt progressed due to changes in DOC and CO2 source supply. The study highlights the importance of using high‐frequency measurements combined with high‐frequency data analyses to identify changes in the processes driving water‐carbon interactions.

Specifically, pyrite, a ubiquitous mineral, commonly oxidizes and depletes in the upper layers of the weathering profile in most humid watersheds, only remaining at depths of meters. We hypothesize that variations in concentrations (C) of pyrite‐derived sulfate released into rivers as a function of discharge (q) reflect the rate limiting step and depth of pyrite‐oxidizing layers. We found that log C – log q behaviors thus differ in small and large watersheds in the Susquehanna River Basin as well as in selected watersheds in the Western United States. Although coal mining changes pyrite oxidation from closed to open system with respect to O2, patterns in stream chemistry as a function of discharge are consistent with deep and shallow pyrite oxidation zones in small and large watersheds respectively.

Traditional methods to estimate groundwater storage change use a combination of groundwater level and storativity estimates, but there is often considerable uncertainty in these. In this study, we demonstrate a new method that relies on a combination of geodetic data from InSAR, as well as groundwater level and pumping data, to estimate both the total groundwater storage loss and the percentages of storage loss in fine‐ and coarse‐grained layers within an aquifer system. We find that when aggregated over all of Parowan Valley, fine‐ and coarse‐grained layers account for roughly equal portions of the total groundwater storage loss. However, in confined aquifers, fine‐grained layers account for most of the storage loss. This has important implications on the source of groundwater in depleting aquifer systems, as many models do not account for fine‐grained layers as a source of water. We find that in the Parowan Valley, the aquifer depletion is roughly 12.5% of the volume of pumped groundwater, meaning that the remainder of pumped groundwater is sourced from net inflow. This study presents the first method that combines geodetic and in‐situ groundwater data to provide estimates of groundwater storage change that account for both coarse‐ and fine‐grained intervals, which are typically present in significant amounts in the major unconsolidated aquifer systems of the world.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In the Parowan Valley of Utah, groundwater levels have declined by as much as 30 meters over the past 50 years with accompanying subsidence rates of up to 5 cm/year.

Coupling groundwater with surface water observations from Sentinel‐2 data provides an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate surface water connectivity with local aquifers following intense precipitation events in arid basins. Surface water area and groundwater level data were analyzed for trends following precipitation, including peak lag time, post‐peak recession rates, and changes in hydraulic gradients. Results indicate variable connectivity following large precipitation events between surface water change and groundwater level fluctuations in the upgradient freshwater aquifer, whereas the downgradient brine‐to‐brackish area of the aquifer indicated virtually no connectivity with the aquifer. Comparison between precipitation and surface water response indicate distinct responses based on the physical relationship of the surface water body with the brine‐to‐brackish area of the aquifer. Lumped parameter modeling of surface water inundation also constrains the possible hydrologic dynamics of the post‐precipitation response. While modeled influx to surface water seems primarily controlled by watershed hydraulics rather than direct hydraulic connectivity of the aquifers, the relationship between surface water and adjacent groundwater levels coupled with surface water area indicates that local aquifers are primarily connected to the surface water bodies through discharge via subsurface infiltration. Modeling results imply that the existence of brine‐adjacent surface water in arid basins relies on upgradient discharge from freshwater aquifers. Our results further support that marginal surface water systems can serve as a critical recharge mechanism to local aquifers.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;In water-stressed hyperarid basins, questions mount over the impacts of anthropogenic groundwater extraction and climate-driven perturbations on groundwater-surface water interactions and the resilience of ecosystem-critical surface water.

However, the downstream branches of a bifurcation can be linked by a connecting channel cutting through deltaic floodplains. The floodplain connecting channel as a downstream control can affect water partitioning at the river bifurcation and hence the hydrological connectivity of the river network. However, its effects are still largely elusive. In this study, we explored how a connecting channel linking downstream branches affects water partitioning at the upstream bifurcation and water distribution along the two branches. The investigation was conducted through idealized numerical simulations using Delft3D, followed by analysis of the cascading effects on the hydrological connectivity of river networks using graph theory. The results show that connecting channels can mitigate asymmetric water partitioning at the upstream bifurcation. However, this happens at the expense of inducing more uneven flow at the downstream outlets. The flow adjustment is due to the altered spatial water surface slope in the two branches associated with the flow exchange from one channel to the other via the connecting channel. Further analysis of hydrological connectivity shows that connecting channels can generally reduce the vulnerability of the channel network to hydrological alterations, especially changing inflow, by enhancing flow exchange between the two branches. Our results suggest that connecting channels are critical paths for hydrological connectivity, which have important implications for the management of deltaic river networks and their floodplains.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;A river bifurcation is critical for distributing water, sediment and nutrients to the downstream branches of deltaic river networks.

In this study, 3‐D paleo‐hydrogeological variable‐density groundwater flow and salt transport modeling (“paleo‐modeling”) is applied to reconstruct the evolution of groundwater salinities during the Holocene, that is, the last 9,000 years, in Northwestern Germany. Novel aspects of this study include the consideration of highly resolved time‐variant boundary conditions in a 3‐D paleo‐modeling framework, for example, sea‐level rise, surface elevation and coastline changes, development of drainage networks and groundwater abstraction, as well as the quantification of isolated processes impacting salinization. Results show that salinization was a function of sea‐level rise from 9000 BP until 1300 CE. The creation of the dike line ∼1300 CE set the starting point for increasing anthropogenic control of the hydro(geo)logical system: changes in surface elevation and drainage of low‐lying marshes have become main drivers for salinization after 1600 CE when peat was artificially degenerated. Moreover, changes in the dike line caused by storm floods impacted the salinities. Model results for 2020 CE match well with present‐day salinity observations. Yet, salinization will continue in the future, as the hydro(geo)logical system has not reached an equilibrium. The presented paleo‐modeling framework can be viewed as a blueprint for similar low‐lying coastal groundwater systems, influenced by marine transgression and human development. Thereby, it enables the reconstruction of meaningful present‐day salinity distributions, serving as a vital basis for modeling future groundwater systems in a changing climate.</dc:description><content:encoded> &lt;h2>;Abstract&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Groundwater abstraction and drainage are considered to be the main drivers for the salinization of low-lying coastal groundwater systems, while the role of past boundary conditions is less clear.

The rough‐bed simulations resolve the flow past the exposed part of a gravel bed, whose surface is obtained from a laboratory experiment that also provides some additional data for validation of the numerical model. Results are also discussed for the limiting case of a horizontal smooth bed. Additionally, the effects of varying the level of burial of the mussel inside the substrate and the discharge through the two mussel siphons are investigated via a set of simulations in which the ratio between the median diameter of the (gravel) particles forming the rough bed, d50, and the height of the exposed part of the mussel, h, varies between 0.10 and 0.22. The increase of the bed roughness is associated with a strong amplification of the turbulence kinetic energy in the near‐wake region. Increasing the bed roughness and/or reducing h intensifies the interactions of the eddies generated by the bed particles with the base and tip vortices induced by the active filtering and by the mussel shell, respectively, which, in turn, induces a more rapid dissipation of these vortices. Increasing the bed roughness also reduces the strength of the main downwelling flow region forming in the wake. The strong downwelling near the symmetry plane is the main reason why the symmetric wake shedding mode dominates in the smooth bed simulations with negligible active filtering. By contrast, the anti‐symmetric wake shedding mode dominates in the simulations conduced with a high value of the bed roughness. The mean streamwise drag force coefficient for the emerged part of the shell and the dilution of the excurrent siphon jet increase with increasing bed roughness.
